Act One
The living-room of a house in a seaside town. A door leading to the hall down left. Back door and small window up left. Kitchen hatch, centre back. Kitchen door up right. Table and chairs, centre.
PETEY enters from the door on the left with a paper and sits at the table. He begins to read. MEG's voice comes through the kitchen hatch.
MEG. Is that you, Petey?
Pause.
Petey, is that you?
Pause.
Petey?
PETEY. What?
MEG. Is that you?
PETEY. Yes, it's me.
MEG. What? (Her face appears at the hatch.) Are you back?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. I've got your cornflakes ready. (She disappears and re-appears.) Here's your cornflakes.
He rises and takes the plate from her, sits at the table, props up the paper and begins to eat. MEG enters by the kitchen door.
Are they nice?
PETEY. Very nice.
MEG. I thought they'd be nice. (She sits at the table.) You got your paper?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. Is it good?
PETEY. Not bad.
MEG. What does it say?
PETEY. Nothing much.
MEG. You read me out some nice bits yesterday.
PETEY. Yes, well, I haven't finished this one yet.
MEG. Will you tell me when you come to something good?
PETEY. Yes.
Pause.
MEG. Have you been working hard this morning?
PETEY. No. Just stacked a few of the old chairs. Cleaned up a bit.
MEG. Is it nice out?
PETEY. Very nice.
Pause.
MEG. Is Stanley up yet?
PETEY. I don't know. Is he?
MEG. I don't know. I haven't seen him down yet.
PETEY. Well then, he can't be up.
MEG. Haven't you seen him down?
PETEY. I've only just come in.
MEG. He must be still asleep.
She looks round the room, stands, goes to the sideboard and takes a pair of socks from a drawer, collects wool and a needle and goes back to the table.
What time did you go out this morning, Petey?
PETEY. Same time as usual.
MEG. Was it dark?
PETEY. No, it was light.
MEG (beginning to darn). But sometimes you go out in the morning and it's dark.
PETEY. That's in the winter.
MEG. Oh, in winter.
PETEY. Yes, it gets light later in winter.
MEG. Oh.
Pause.
What are you reading?
PETEY. Someone's just had a baby.
MEG. Oh, they haven't! Who?
PETEY. Some girl.
MEG. Who, Petey, who?
PETEY. I don't think you'd know her.
MEG. What's her name?
PETEY. Lady Mary Splatt.
MEG. I don't know her.
PETEY. No.
MEG. What is it?
PETEY (studying the paper). Er-a girl.
MEG. Not a boy?
PETEY. No.
MEG. Oh, what a shame. I'd be sorry. I'd much rather have a little boy.
PETEY. A little girl's all right.
MEG. I'd much rather have a little boy.
Pause.
PETEY. I've finished my cornflakes.
MEG. Were they nice?
PETEY. Very nice.
MEG. I've got something else for you.
PETEY. Good.
She rises, takes his plate and exits into the kitchen. She then appears at the hatch with two pieces of fried bread on a plate.
MEG. Here you are, Petey.
He rises, collects the plate, looks at it, sits at the table. MEG re-enters.
Is it nice?
PETEY. I haven't tasted it yet.
MEG. I bet you don't know what it is.
PETEY. Yes, I do.
MEG. What is it, then?
PETEY. Fried bread.
MEG. That's right.
He begins to eat.
She watches him eat.
PETEY. Very nice.
MEG. I knew it was.
PETEY (turning to her). Oh, Meg, two men came up to me on the beach last night.
MEG. Two men?
PETEY. Yes. They wanted to know if we could put them up for a couple of nights.
MEG. Put them up? Here?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. How many men?
PETEY. Two.
MEG. What did you say?
PETEY. Well, I said I didn't know. So they said they'd come round to find out.
MEG. Are they coming?
PETEY. Well, they said they would.
MEG. Had they heard about us, Petey?
PETEY. They must have done.
MEG. Yes, they must have done. They must have heard this was a very good boarding house. It is. This house is on the list.
PETEY. It is.
MEG. I know it is.
PETEY. They might turn up today. Can you do it?
MEG. Oh, I've got that lovely room they can have.
PETEY. You've got a room ready?
MEG. I've got the room with the armchair all ready for visitors.
PETEY. You're sure?
MEG. Yes, that'll be all right then, if they come today.
PETEY. Good.
She takes the socks etc. back to the sideboard drawer.
MEG. I'm going to wake that boy.
PETEY. There's a new show coming to the Palace.
MEG. On the pier?
PETEY. No. The Palace, in the town.
MEG. Stanley could have been in it, if it was on the pier.
PETEY. This is a straight show.
MEG. What do you mean?
PETEY. No dancing or singing.
MEG. What do they do then?
PETEY. They just talk.
Pause.
MEG. Oh.
PETEY. You like a song eh, Meg?
MEG. I like listening to the piano. I used to like watching Stanley play the piano. Of course, he didn't sing. (Looking at the door.) I'm going to call that boy.
PETEY. Didn't you take him up his cup of tea?
MEG. I always take him up his cup of tea. But that was a long time ago.
PETEY. Did he drink it?
MEG. I made him. I stood there till he did. I'm going to call him. (She goes to the door.) Stan! Stanny! (She listens.) Stan! I'm coming up to fetch you if you don't come down!
I'm coming up! I'm going to count three! One! Two!
Three! I'm coming to get you! (She exits and goes upstairs.
In a moment, shouts from STANLEY, wild laughter from MEG. PETEY takes his plate to the hatch. Shouts. Laughter.
PETEY sits at the table. Silence. She returns.) He's coming down. (She is panting and arranges her hair.) I told him if he didn't hurry up he'd get no breakfast.
PETEY. That did it, eh?
MEG. I'll get his cornflakes.
MEG exits to the kitchen. PETEY reads the paper. STANLEY enters. He is unshaven, in his pyjama jacket and wears glasses. He sits at the table.
PETEY. Morning, Stanley.
STANLEY. Morning.
Silence. MEG enters with the bowl of cornflakes, which she sets on the table.
MEG. So he's come down at last, has he? He's come down at last for his breakfast. But he doesn't deserve any, does he, Petey? (STANLEY stares at the cornflakes.) Did you sleep well?
STANLEY. I didn't sleep at all.
MEG. You didn't sleep at all? Did you hear that, Petey? Too tired to eat your breakfast, I suppose? Now you eat up those cornflakes like a good boy. Go on.
He begins to eat.
STANLEY. What's it like out today?
PETEY. Very nice.
STANLEY. Warm?
PETEY. Well, there's a good breeze blowing.
STANLEY. Cold?
PETEY. No, no, I wouldn't say it was cold.
MEG. What are the cornflakes like, Stan?
STANLEY. Horrible.
MEG. Those flakes? Those lovely flakes? You're a liar, a little liar. They're refreshing. It says so. For people when they ger up late.
STANLEY. The milk's off.
MEG. It's not. Petey ate his, didn't you, Petey?
PETEY. That's right.
MEG. There you are then.
STANLEY. All right, I'll go on to the second course.
MEG. He hasn't finished the first course and he wants to go on to the second course!
STANLEY. I feel like something cooked.
MEG. Well, I'm not going to give it to you, PETEY. Give it to him.
MEG (sitting at the table, right). I'm not going to.
Pause.
STANLEY. No breakfast.
Pause.
All night long I've been dreaming about this breakfast.
MEG. I thought you said you didn't sleep.
STANLEY. Day-dreaming. All night long. And now she won't give me any. Not even a crust of bread on the table.
Pause.
Well, I can see I'll have to go down to one of those smart hotels on the front.
MEG (rising quickly). You won't get a better breakfast there than here.
She exits to the kitchen. STANLEY yawns broadly. MEG appears at the hatch with a plate.
Here you are. You'll like this.
PETEY rises, collects the plate, brings it to the table, puts it in front of STANLEY, and sits.
STANLEY. What's this?
PETEY. Fried bread.
MEG (entering). Well, I bet you don't know what it is.
STANLEY. Oh yes I do.
MEG. What?
STANLEY. Fried bread.
MEG. He knew.
STANLEY. What a wonderful surprise.
MEG. You didn't expect that, did you?
STANLEY. I bloody well didn't.
PETEY (rising). Well, I'm off.
MEG. You going back to work?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. Your tea! You haven't had your tea!
PETEY. That's all right. No time now.
MEG. I've got it made inside.
PETEY. No, never mind. See you later. Ta-ta, Stan.
STANLEY. Ta-ta.
PETEY exits, left.
Tch, tch, tch, tch.
MEG (defensively). What do you mean?
STANLEY. You're a bad wife.
MEG. I'm not. Who said I am?
STANLEY. Not to make your husband a cup of tea. Terrible.
MEG. He knows I'm not a bad wife.
STANLEY. Giving him sour milk instead.
MEG. It wasn't sour.
STANLEY. Disgraceful.
MEG. You mind your own business, anyway. (STANLEY eats.)
You won't find many better wives than me, I can tell you. I keep a very nice house and I keep it clean.
STANLEY. Whoo!
MEG. Yes! And this house is very well known, for a very good boarding house for visitors.
STANLEY. Visitors? Do you know how many visitors you've had since I've been here?
MEG. How many?
STANLEY. One.
MEG. Who?
STANLEY. Me! I'm your visitor.
MEG. You're a liar. This house is on the list.
STANLEY. I bet it is.
MEG. I know it is.
He pushes his plate away and picks up the paper.
Was it nice?
STANLEY. What?
MEG. The fried bread.
STANLEY. Succulent.
MEG. You shouldn't say that word.
STANLEY. What word?
MEG. That word you said.
STANLEY. What, succulent—?
MEG. Don't say it!
STANLEY. What's the matter with it?
MEG. You shouldn't say that word to a married woman.
STANLEY. Is that a fact?
MEG. Yes.
STANLEY. Well, I never knew that.
MEG. Well, it's true.
STANLEY. Who told you that?
MEG. Never you mind.
STANLEY. Well, if I can't say it to a married woman who can I say it to?
MEG. You're bad.
STANLEY. What about some tea?
MEG. Do you want some tea? (STANLEY reads the paper.) Say please.
STANLEY. Please.
MEG. Say sorry first.
STANLEY. Sorry first.
MEG. No. Just sorry.
STANLEY. Just sorry!
MEG. You deserve the strap.
STANLEY. Don't do that!
She takes his plate and ruffles his hair as she passes, STANLEY exclaims and throws her arm away. She goes into the leirchen. He rubs his eyes under his glasses and picks up the paper. She enters.
I brought the pot in.
STANLEY (absently). I don't know what I'd do without you.
MEG. You don't deserve it though.
STANLEY. Why not?
MEG (pouring the tea, coyly). Go on. Calling me that.
STANLEY. How long has that tea been in the pot?
MEG. It's good tea. Good strong tea.
STANLEY. This isn't tea. It's gravy!
MEG. It's not.
STANLEY. Get out of it. You succulent old washing bag.
MEG. I am not! And it isn't your place to tell me if I am!
STANLEY. And it isn't your place to come into a man's bedroom and-wake him up.
MEG. Stanny! Don't you like your cup of tea of a morning-the one I bring you?
STANLEY. I can't drink this muck. Didn't anyone ever tell you to warm the pot, at least?
MEG. That's good strong tea, that's all.
STANLEY (putting his head in his hands). Oh God, I'm tired.
Silence. MEG goes to the sideboard, collects a duster, and vaguely dusts the room, watching him. She comes to the table and dusts it.
Not the bloody table!
Pause.
MEG. Stan?
STANLEY. What?
MEG (shyly). Am I really succulent?
STANLEY. Oh, you are. I'd rather have you than a cold in the nose any day.
MEG. You're just saying that.
STANLEY (violently). Look, why don't you get this place cleared up! It's a pigsty. And another thing, what about my room? It needs sweeping. It needs papering. I need a new room!
MEG (sensual, stroking his arm). Oh, Stan, that's a lovely room.
I've had some lovely afternoons in that room.
He recoils from her hand in disgust, stands and exits quickly by the door on the left. She collects his cup and the teapot and takes them to the hatch shelf. The street door slams.
STANLEY returns.
MEG. Is the sun shining? (He crosses to the window, takes a cigarette and matches from his pyjama jacket, and lights his cigarette.) What are you smoking?
STANLEY. A cigarette.
MEG. Are you going to give me one?
STANLEY. No.
MEG. I like cigarettes. (He stands at the window, smoking. She crosses behind him and tickles the back of his neck.) Tickle, tickle.
STANLEY (pushing her). Get away from me.
MEG. Are you going out?
STANLEY. Not with you.
MEG. But I'm going shopping in a minute.
STANLEY. Go.
MEG. You'll be lonely, all by yourself.
STANLEY. Will I?
MEG. Without your old Meg. I've got to get things in for the two gentlemen.
A pause. STANLEY slowly raises his head. He speaks withous turning.
STANLEY. What two gentlemen?
MEG. I'm expecting visitors.
He turns.
STANLEY. What?
MEG. You didn't know that, did you?
STANLEY. What are you talking about?
MEG. Two gentlemen asked Petey if they could come and stay for a couple of nights. I'm expecting them. (She picks up the duster and begins to wipe the cloth on the table.)
STANLEY. I don't believe it.
MEG. It's true.
STANLEY (moving to her). You're saying it on purpose.
MEG. Petey told me this morning.
STANLEY (grinding his cigarette). When was this? When did he see them?
MEG. Last night.
STANLEY. Who are they?
MEG. I don't know.
STANLEY. Didn't he tell you their names?
MEG. No.
STANLEY (pacing the room). Here? They wanted to come here?
MEG. Yes, they did. (She takes the curlers out of her hair.)
STANLEY. Why?
MEG. This house is on the list.
STANLEY. But who are they?
MEG. You'll see when they come.
STANLEY (decisively). They won't come.
MEG. Why not?
STANLEY (quickly). I tell you they won't come. Why didn't they come last night, if they were coming?
MEG. Perhaps they couldn't find the place in the dark. It's not easy to find in the dark.
STANLEY. They won't come. Someone's taking the Michael.
Forget all about it. It's a false alarm. A false alarm. (He sits at the table.) Where's my tea?
MEG. I took it away. You didn't want it.
STANLEY. What do you mean, you took it away?
MEG. I took it away.
STANLEY. What did you take it away for?
MEG. You didn't want it!
STANLEY. Who said I didn't want it?
MEG. You did!
STANLEY. Who gave you the right to take away my tea?
MEG. You wouldn't drink it.
STANLEY stares at her.
STANLEY (quietly). Who do you think you're talking to?
MEG (uncertainly). What?
STANLEY. Come here.
MEG. What do you mean?
STANLEY. Come over here.
MEG. No.
STANLEY. I want to ask you something. (MEG fidgets ner-vously. She does not go to him.) Come on. (Pause.) All right.
I can ask it from here just as well. (Deliberately.) Tell me, Mrs Boles, when you address yourself to me, do you ever ask yourself who exactly you are talking to? Eh?
Silence. He groans, his trunk falls forward, his head falls into his hands.
MEG (in a small voice). Didn't you enjoy your breakfast, Stan?
(She approaches the table.) Stan? When are you going to play the piano again? (STANLEY grunts.) Like you used to?
(STANLEY grunts.) I used to like watching you play the piano. When are you going to play it again?
STANLEY. I can't, can I?
MEG. Why not?
STANLEY. I haven't got a piano, have I?
MEG. No, I meant like when you were working. That piano
STANLEY. Go and do your shopping.
MEG. But you wouldn't have to go away if you got a job, would you? You could play the piano on the pier.
He looks at her, then speaks airily.
STANLEY. I've... er... I've been offered a job, as a matter of fact.
MEG. What?
STANLEY. Yes. I'm considering a job at the moment.
MEG. You're not.
STANLEY. A good one, too. A night club. In Berlin.
MEG. Berlin?
STANLEY. Berlin. A night club. Playing the piano. A fabulous salary. And all found.
MEG. How long for?
STANLEY. We don't stay in Berlin. Then we go to Athens.
MEG. How long for?
STANLEY. Yes. Then we pay a flying visit to ... er whatsisname...•
MEG. Where?
STANLEY. Constantinople. Zagreb. Vladivostock. It's a round the world tour.
MEG (sitting at the table). Have you played the piano in those places before?
STANLEY. Played the piano? I've played the piano all over the world. All over the country. (Pause.) I once gave a concert.
MEG. A concert?
STANLEY (reflectively). Yes. It was a good one, too. They were all there that night. Every single one of them. It was a great success. Yes. A concert. At Lower Edmonton.
MEG. What did you wear?
STANLEY (to himself). I had a unique touch. Absolutely unique.
They came up to me. They came up to me and said they
were grateful. Champagne we had that night, the lot. (Pause.) My father nearly came down to hear me. Well, I dropped him a card anyway. But I don't think he could make it. No,
I-I lost the address, that was it. (Pause.) Yes. Lower Ed-monton. Then after that, you know what they did? They carved me up. Carved me up. It was all arranged, it was all worked out. My next concert. Somewhere else it was. In winter. I went down there to play. Then, when I got there, the hall was closed, the place was shuttered up, not even a caretaker. They'd locked it up. (Takes off his glasses and wipes them on his pyjama jacket.) A fast one. They pulled a fast one. I'd like to know who was responsible for that.
(Bitterly.) All right, Jack, I can take a tip. They want me to crawl down on my bended knees. Well I can take a tip ... any day of the week. (He replaces his glasses, then looks az MEG.) Look at her. You're just an old piece of rock cake, aren't you? (He rises and leans across the table to her.) That's what you are, aren't you?
MEG. Don't you go away again, Stan. You stay here. You'll be better off. You stay with your old Meg. (He groans and lies across the table.) Aren't you feeling well this morning, Stan. Did you pay a visit this morning?
He stiffens, then lifts himself slowly, turns to face her and speaks lightly, casually.
STANLEY. Meg. Do you know what?
MEG. What?
STANLEY. Have you heard the latest?
MEG. No.
STANLEY. I'll bet you have.
MEG. I haven't.
STANLEY. Shall I tell you?
MEG. What latest?
STANLEY. You haven't heard it?
MEG. No.
STANLEY (advancing.) They're coming today. They're coming in a van.
MEG. Who?
STANLEY. And do you know what they've got in that van?
MEG. What?
STANLEY. They've got a wheelbarrow in that van.
MEG (breathlessly). They haven't.
STANLEY. Oh yes they have.
MEG. You're a liar.
STANLEY (advancing upon her). A big wheelbarrow. And when the van stops they wheel it out, and they wheel it up the garden path, and then they knock at the front door.
MEG. They don't.
STANLEY. They're looking for someone.
MEG. They're not.
STANLEY. They're looking for someone. A certain person.
MEG (hoarsely). No, they're not!
STANLEY. Shall I tell you who they're looking for?
MEG. No!
STANLEY. You don't want me to tell you?
MEG. You're a liar!


A sudden knock on the front door. LULU's voice: Ooh-ooh!
MEG edges past STANLEY and collects her shopping bag.
MEG goes out. STANLEY sidles to the door and listens.


VOICE (through letter box). Hullo, Mrs Boles ...
MEG. Oh, has it come?
VOICE. Yes, it's just come.
MEG. What, is that it?
VOICE. Yes. I thought I'd bring it round.
MEG. Is it nice?
VOICE. Very nice. What shall I do with it?
MEG. Well, I don't ... (Whispers.)
VOICE. No, of course not ...(Whispers.)
MEG. All right, but ... (Whispers.)
vOICE. I won't ... (Whispers.) Ta-ta, Mrs Boles.
STANLEY quickly sits at the table. Enter LULU.
LULU. Oh, hullo.
STANLEY. Ay-ay.
LULU. I just want to leave this in here.
STANLEY. Do. (LULU crosses to the sideboard and puts a solid, round parcel upon it.) That's a bulky object.
LULU. You're not to touch it.
STANLEY. Why would I want to touch it?
LULU. Well, you're not to, anyway.
LULU walks upstage.
LULU. Why don't you open the door? It's all stuffy in here.
She opens the back door.
STANLEY (rising): Stuffy? I disinfected the place this morning.
LULU (at the door). Oh, that's better.
STANLEY. I think it's going to rain to-day. What do you think?
LULU. I hope so. You could do with it.
STANLEY. Me! I was in the sea at half past six.
LULU. Were you?
STANLEY. I went right out to the headland and back before breakfast. Don't you believe me!
She sits, takes out a compact and powders her nose.
LULU (offering him the compact). Do you want to have a look at your face? (STANLEY withdraws from the table.) You could do with a shave, do you know that? (STANLEY sits, right at the table.) Don't you ever go out? (He does not answer.) I mean, what do you do, just sit around the house like this all day long? (Pause.) Hasn't Mrs Boles got enough to do without having you under her feet all day long?
MEG. All right, but ... (Whispers.)
voIcE. I won't ... (Whispers.) Ta-ta, Mrs Boles.
STANLEY quickly sits at the table. Enter LULU.
LULU. Oh, hullo.
STANLEY. Ay-ay.
LULU. I just want to leave this in here.
STANLEY. Do. (LUL crosses to the sideboard and puts a solid, round parcel upon it.) That's a bulky object.
LULU. You're not to touch it.
STANLEY. Why would I want to touch it?
LULU. Well, you're not to, anyway.
LULU walks upstage.
LULU. Why don't you open the door? It's all stuffy in here.
She opens the back door.
STANLEY (rising): Stuffy? I disinfected the place this morning.
LULU (at the door). Oh, that's better.
STANLEY. I think it's going to rain to-day. What do you think?
LULU. I hope so. You could do with it.
STANLEY. Me! I was in the sea at half past six.
LULU. Were you?
STANLEY. I went right out to the headland and back before breakfast. Don't you believe me!
She sits, takes out a compact and powders her nose.
LULU (offering him the compact). Do you want to have a look at your face? (STANLEY withdraws from the table.) You could do with a shave, do you know that? (STANLEY sits, right at the table.) Don't you ever go out? (He does not answer.) I mean, what do you do, just sit around the house like this all day long? (Pause.) Hasn't Mrs Boles got enough to do without having you under her feet all day long?
STANLEY. I always stand on the table when she sweeps the floor.
LULU. Why don't you have a wash? You look terrible.
STANLEY. A wash wouldn't make any difference.
LULU (rising). Come out and get a bit of air. You depress me, looking like that.
STANLEY. Air? Oh, I don't know about that.
LULU. It's lovely out. And I've got a few sandwiches.
STANLEY. What sort of sandwiches?
LULU. Cheese.
STANLEY. I'm a big eater, you know.
LULU. That's all right. I'm not hungry.
STANLEY (abruptly). How would you like to go away with me?
LULU. Where.
STANLEY. Nowhere. Still, we could go.
LULU. But where could we go?
STANLEY. Nowhere. There's nowhere to go. So we could just go. It wouldn't matter.
LULU. We might as well stay here.
STANLEY. No. It's no good here.
LULU. Well, where else is there?
STANLEY. Nowhere.
LULU. Well, that's a charming proposal. (He gets up.) Do you have to wear those glasses?
STANLEY. Yes.
LULU. So you're not coming out for a walk?
STANLEY. I can't at the moment.
LULU. You're a bit of a washout, aren't you?


She exits, left. STANLEY stands. He then goes to the mirror and looks in it. He goes into the kitchen, takes off his glasses and begins to wash his face. A pause. Enter, by the back door, GOLDBERG and MCCANN. MCCANN carries two suitcases, GOLDBERG a briefcase. They halt inside the door, then walk downstage. STANLEY, wiping his face, glimpses their backs through the hatch. GOLDBERG and MCCANN look round the room. STANLEY slips on his glasses, sidles through the kitchen door and out of the back door.


MCCANN. Is this it?
GOLDBERG. This is it.
MCCANN. Are you sure?
GOLDBERG. Sure I'm sure.
Pause.
MCCANN. What now?
GOLDBERG. Don't worry yourself, McCann. Take a seat.
MCCANN. What about you?
GOLDBERG. What about me?
MCCANN. Are you going to take a seat?
GOLDBERG. We'll both take a seat. (MCCANN puts down the suitcase and sits at the table, left.) Sit back, McCann. Relax, What's the matter with you? I bring you down for a few days to the seaside. Take a holiday. Do yourself a favour. Learn to relax, McCann, or you'll never get anywhere.
MCCANN. Ah sure, I do try, Nat.
GOLDBERG (sitting at the table, right). The secret is breathing.
Take my tip. It's a well-known fact. Breathe in, breathe out, take a chance, let yourself go, what can you lose? Look at me. When I was an apprentice yet, McCann, every second Friday of the month my Uncle Barney used to take me to the seaside, regular as clockwork. Brighton, Canvey Island, Rottingdean—Uncle Barney wasn't particular. After lunch on Shabbuss we'd go and sit in a couple of deck chairs— you know, the ones with canopies—-we'd have a little paddle, we'd watch the tide coming in, going out, the sun coming down-golden days, believe me, McCann. (Reminiscent.) Uncle Barney, Of course, he was an impeccable dresser.
One of the old school. He had a house just outside Basing-stoke at the time. Respected by the whole community.
walk downstage. STANLEY, wiping his face, glimpses their backs through the hatch. GOLDBERG and MCCANN look round the room. STANLEY slips on his glasses, sidles through the kitchen door and out of the back door.
MCCANN. Is this it?
GOLDBERG. This is it.
MCCANN. Are you sure?
GOLDBERG. Sure I'm sure.
Pause.
MCCANN. What now?
GOLDBERG. Don't worry yourself, McCann. Take a seat.
MCCANN. What about you?
GOLDBERG. What about me?
MCCANN. Are you going to take a seat?
GOLDBERG. We'll both take a seat. (MCCANN puts down the suitcase and sits at the table, left.) Sit back, McCann. Relax.

After lunch on Shabbuss we'd go and sit in a couple of deck chairs— you know, the ones with canopies—-we'd have a little paddle, we'd watch the tide coming in, going out, the sun coming down-golden days, believe me, McCann. (Reminiscent.) Uncle Barney. Of course, he was an impeccable dresser.
One of the old school. He had a house just outside Basing-stoke at the time. Respected by the whole community.
Culture? Don't talk to me about culture. He was an all-round man, what do you mean? He was a cosmopolitan, MCCANN. Hey, Nat...•
GOLDBERG (reflectively). Yes. One of the old school.
MCCANN. Nat. How do we know this is the right house?
GOLDBERG. What?
MCCANN. How do we know this is the right house?
GOLDBERG. What makes you think it's the wrong house?
MCCANN. I didn't see a number on the gate.
GOLDBERG. I wasn't looking for a number.
MCCANN. No?
GOLDBERG (settling in the armchair). You know one thing Uncle Barney taught me? Uncle Barney taught me that the word of a gentleman is enough. That's why, when I had to go away on business I never carried any money. One of my sons used to come with me. He used to carry a few coppers.
For a paper, perhaps, to see how the M.C.C. was getting on overseas. Otherwise my name was good. Besides, I was a very busy man.
MCCANN. What about this, Nat? Isn't it about time someone came in?
GOLDBERG. McCann, what are you so nervous about? Pull yourself together. Everywhere you go these days it's like a funeral.
MCCANN. That's true.
GOLDBERG. True? Of course it's true. It's more than true. It's a fact.
MCCANN. You may be right.
GOLDBERG. What is it, McCann? You don't trust me like you did in the old days?
MCCANN. Sure I trust you, Nat.
GOLDBERG. But why is it that before you do a job you're all over the place, and when you're doing the job you're as cool as a whistle?
MCCANN. I don't know, Nat. I'm just all right once I know what I'm doing. When I know what I'm doing, I'm all right.
GOLDBERG. Well, you do it very well.
MCCANN. Thank you, Nat.
GOLDBERG. You know what I said when this job came up. I mean naturally they approached me to take care of it. And you know who I asked for?
MCCANN. Who?
GOLDBERG. You.
MCCANN. That was very good of you, Nat.
GOLDBERG. No, it was nothing. You're a capable man, McCann.
MCCANN. That's a great compliment, Nat, coming from a man in your position.
GOLDBERG. Well, I've got a position, I won't deny it.
MCCANN. You certainly have.
GOLDBERG. I would never deny that I had a position.
MCCANN. And what a position!
GOLDBERG. It's not a thing I would deny.
MCCANN. Yes, it's true, you've done a lot for me. I appreciate
GOLDBERG. Say no more.
MCCANN. You've always been a true Christian.
GOLDBERG. In a way.
MCCANN. No, I just thought I'd tell you that I appreciate it.
GOLDBERG. It's unnecessary to recapitulate.
MCCANN. You're right there.
GOLDBERG. Quite unnecessary.
Pause. MCCANN leans forward.
MCCANN. Hey Nat, just one thing....
GOLDBERG. What now?
MCCANN. This job-no, listen-this job, is it going to be like anything we've ever done before?
GOLDBERG, Tch, tch, tch.
MCCANN. No, just tell me that. Just that, and I won't ask any more.
GOLDBERG sighs, stands, goes behind the rable, ponders, Looks aB MCCANN, and then speaks in a quiet, uent, ficial
tone.
GOLDBERG. The main issue is a singular issue and quite distinct from your previous work. Certain elements, however, might well approximate in points of procedure to some of your other activities. All is dependent on the attitude of our subject. At all events, McCann, I can assure you that the assignment will be carried out and the mission accomplished with no excessive aggravation to you or myself. Satisfied?
MCCANN. Sure. Thank you, Nat.
MEG enters, left.
GOLDBERG. Ah, Mrs Boles?
MEG. Yes?
GOLDBERG. We spoke to your husband last night. Perhaps he mentioned us? We heard that you kindly let rooms for gentlemen. So I brought my friend along with me. We were after a nice place, you understand. So we came to you. I'm Mr Goldberg and this is Mr McCann.
MEG. Very pleased to meet you.
They shake hands.
GOLDBERG. We're pleased to meet you, too.
MEG. That's very nice.
GOLDBERG. You're right. How often do you meet someone it's a pleasure to meet?
MCCANN. Never.
GOLDBERG. But today it's different. How are you keeping,
Mrs Boles?
MEG. Oh, very well, thank you.
GOLDBERG. Yes? Really?
MEG. Oh yes, really.
GOLDBERG. I'm glad.
GOLDBERG sits at the table, right.
GOLDBERG. Well, so what do you say? You can manage to put us up, eh, Mrs Boles?
MEG. Well, it would have been easier last week.
GOLDBERG. It would, eh?
MEG. Yes.
GOLDBERG. Why? How many have you got here at the moment?
MEG. Just one at the moment.
GOLDBERG. Just one?
MEG. Yes. Just one. Until you came.
GOLDBERG. And your husband, of course?
MEG. Yes, but he sleeps with me.
GOLDBERG. What does he do, your husband?
MEG. He's a deck-chair attendant.
GOLDBERG. Oh, very nice.
MEG. Yes, he's out in all weathers.
She begins to take her purchases from her bag.
GOLDBERG. Of course. And your guest? Is he a man?
MEG. A man?
GOLDBERG. Or a woman?
MEG. No. A man.
GOLDBERG. Been here long?
MEG. He's been here about a year now.
GOLDBERG. Oh yes. A resident. What's his name?
MEG. Stanley Webber.
GOLDBERG. Oh yes? Does he work here?
MEG. He used to work. He used to be a pianist. In a concert party on the pier.
GOLDBERG. Oh yes? On the pier, eh? Does he play a nice piano?
MEG. Oh, lovely. (She sits at the table.) He once gave a concert.
GOLDBERG. Oh? Where?
MEG (falteringly). In ... a big hall. His father gave him champagne. But then they locked the place up and he couldn't get out. The caretaker had gone home. So he had to wait until the morning before he could get out. (With confidence.) They were very grateful. (Pause.) And then they all wanted to give him a tip. And so he took the tip. And then he got a fast train and he came down here.
GOLDBERG. Really?
MEG. Oh yes. Straight down.
Pause.
MEG. I wish he could have played tonight.
GOLDBERG. Why tonight?
MEG. It's his birthday today.
GOLDBERG. His birthday?
MEG. Yes. Today. But I'm not going to tell him until tonight.
GOLDBERG. Doesn't he know it's his birthday?
MEG. He hasn't mentioned it.
GOLDBERG (thoughtfully). Ah! Tell me. Are you going to have a party?
MEG. A party?
GOLDBERG. Weren't you going to have one?
MEG (her eyes wide). No.
GOLDBERG. Well, of course, you must have one. (He stands.)
We'll have a party, eh? What do you say?
MEG. Oh yes!
GOLDBERG. Sure. We'll give him a party. Leave it to me.
MEG. Oh, that's wonderful, Mr Gold—
GOLDBERG. Berg.
MEG. Berg.
GOLDBERG. You like the idea?
MEG. Oh, I'm so glad you came today.
GOLDBERG. If we hadn't come today we'd have come to-morrow. Still, I'm glad we came today. Just in time for his birthday.
MEG. I wanted to have a party But you must have people for a party.
GOLDBERG. And now you've got McCann and me. McCann's the life and soul of any party.
MCCANN. What?
GOLDBERG. What do you think of that, McCann? There's a gentleman living here. He's got a birthday today, and he's forgotten all about it. So we're going to remind him. We're going to give him a party.
MCCANN. Oh, is that a fact?
MEG. Tonight.
GOLDBERG. Tonight.
MEG. I'll put on my party dress.
GOLDBERG. And I'll get some bottles.
MEG. And I'll invite Lulu this afternoon. Oh, this is going to cheer Stanley up. It will. He's been down in the dumps lately.
GOLDBERG. We'll bring him out of himself.
MEG. I hope I look nice in my dress.
GOLDBERG. Madam, you'll look like a tulip.
MEG. What colour?
GOLDBERG. Er-well, I'll have to see the dress first.
MCCANN. Could I go up to my room?
MEG. Oh, I've put you both together. Do you mind being both together?
GOLDBERG. I don't mind. Do you mind, McCann?
MCCANN. No.
MEG. What time shall we have the party?
GOLDBERG. Nine o'clock.
MCCANN (at the door). Is this the way?
MEG (rising). I'll show you. If you don't mind coming upstairs.
GOLDBERG. With a tulip? It's a pleasure.
MEG and GOLDBERG exit laughing, followed by MCCANN.
STANLEY appears at the window. He enters by the back
door. He goes to the door on the left, opens it and listens.
Silence, He walks to the table. He stands. He sits, as MEG enters. She crosses and hangs her shopping bag on a hook. He lights a match and watches it burn.
STANLEY. Who is it?
MEG. The two gentlemen.
STANLEY. What two gentlemen?
MEG. The ones that were coming. I just took them to their room. They were thrilled with their room.
STANLEY. They've come?
MEG. They're very nice, Stan.
STANLEY. Why didn't they come last night?
MEG. They said the beds were wonderful.
STANLEY. Who are they?
MEG (sitting). They're very nice, Stanley.
STANLEY. I said, who are they?
MEG. I've told you, the two gentlemen.
STANLEY. I didn't think they'd come.
He rises and walks to the window.
MEG. They have. They were here when I came in.
STANLEY. What do they want here?
MEG. They want to stay.
STANLEY. How long for?
MEG. They didn't say.
STANLEY (turning). But why here? Why not somewhere else?
MEG. This house is on the list.
STANLEY (coming down). What are they called? What are their names?
MEG. Oh, Stanley, I can't remember.
staNLeY. They told you, didn't they? Or didn't they tell you?
MEG. Yes, they....
STANLEY. Then what are they? Come on. Try to remember.
MEG. Why, Stan? Do you know them?
STANLEY. How do I know if I know them until I know their names?
MEG. Well ... he told me, I remember.
STANLEY. Well?
She thinks.
MEG. Gold-something.
STANLEY. Goldsomething?
MEG. Yes. Gold....
STANLEY. Yes?
MEG. Goldberg.
STANLEY. Goldberg?
MEG. That's right. That was one of them.
STANLEY slowly sits at the table, left.
Do you know them?
STANLEY does not answer.
Stan, they won't wake you up, I promise. I'll tell them they must be quiet.
STANLEY sits still.
They won't be here long, Stan. I'll still bring you up your early morning tea.
STANLEY sits still.
You mustn't be sad today. It's your birthday.
A pause.
STANLEY (dumbly). Uh?
MEG. It's your birthday, Stan. I was going to keep it a secret until tonight.
STANLEY. No.
MEG. It is. I've brought you a present. (She goes to the side-board, picks up the parcel, and places it on the table in front of him.) Here. Go on. Open it.
STANLEY. What's this?
MEG. It's your present.
STANLEY. This isn't my birthday, Meg.
MEG. Of course it is. Open your present.
He stares at the parcel, slowly stands, and opens it. He takes out a boy's drum.
STANLEY (flatly). It's a drum. A boy's drum.
MEG (tenderly). It's because you haven't got a piano. (He stares at her, then turns and walks towards the door, left.) Aren't you going to give me a kiss? (He turns sharply, and stops.
He walks back towards her slowly. He stops at her chair, looking down upon her. Pause. His shoulders sag, he bends and kisses her on the cheek.) There are some sticks in there. (STANLEY looks into the parcel. He takes out two drumsticks. He taps them together. He looks at her.)
STANLEY. Shall I put it round my neck?
She watches him, uncertainly. He hangs the drum around his neck, taps it gently with the sticks, then marches round the table, beating it regularly. MEG, pleased, watches him. Still beating it regularly, he begins to go round the table a second time. Halfway round the beat becomes erratic, uncontrolled.
MEG expresses dismay. He arrives at her chair, banging the drum, his face and the drumbeat now savage and possessed.
Curtain
Act Two
MCCANN is sitting at the table tearing a sheet of newspaper into five equal strips. It is evening. After a few moments STANLEY enters from the left. He stops upon seeing MCCANN, and watches him. He then walks towards the kitchen, stops, and speaks.
STANLEY. Evening.
MCCANN. Evening.
Chuckles are heard from outside the back door, which is open.
STANLEY. Very warm tonight. (He turns towards the back door, and back.) Someone out there?
MCCANN tears another length of paper. STANLEY goes into the kitchen and pours a glass of water. He drinks it looking through the hatch. He puts the glass down, comes out of the kitchen and walks quickly towards the door, left. MCCANN rises and intercepts him.
MCCANN. I don't think we've met.
STANLEY. No, we haven't.
MCCANN. My name's McCann.
STANLEY. Staying here long?
MCCANN. Not long. What's your name?
STANLEY. Webber.
MCCANN. I'm glad to meet you, sir. (He offers his hand.
STANLEY takes it, and MCCANN holds the grip.) Many happy returns of the day. (STANLEY withdraws his hand. They face each other.) Were you going out?
STANLEY. Yes.
MCCANN. On your birthday?
STANLEY. Yes. Why not?
MCCANN. But they're holding a party here for you tonight, STANLEY. Oh really? That's unfortunate.
MCCANN. Ah no. It's very nice.
Voices from outside the back door.
STANLEY. I'm sorry. I'm not in the mood for a party tonight, MCCANN. Oh, is that so? I'm sorry.
STANLEY. Yes, I'm going out to celebrate quietly, on my own.
MCCANN. That's a shame.
They stand.
STANLEY. Well, if you'd move out of my way—
MCCANN. But everything's laid on. The guests are expected.
STANLEY. Guests? What guests?
MCCANN. Myself for one. I had the honour of an invitation, MCCANN begins to whistle "The Mountains of Morne".
STANLEY (moving away). I wouldn't call it an honour, would you? It'll just be another booze-up.
STANLEY joins MCCANN in whistling "The Mountains of Morne". During the next five lines the whistling is continuous, one whistling while the other speaks, and both whistling together.
MCCANN. But it is an honour.
STANLEY. I'd say you were exaggerating.
MCCANN. Oh no. I'd say it was an honour.
STANLEY. I'd say that was plain stupid.
MCCANN. Ah no.
They stare at each other.
STANLEY. Who are the other guests?
MCCANN. A young lady.
STANLEY. Oh yes? And....?
MCCANN. My friend.
STANLEY. Your friend?
MCCANN. That's right. It's all laid on.
STANLEY walks round the table towards the door. MCCANN meets him.
STANLEY. Excuse me.
MCCANN. Where are you going?
STANLEY. I want to go out.
MCCANN. Why don't you stay here?
STANLEY moves away, to the right of the table.
STANLEY. So you're down here on holiday?
MCCANN. A short one. (STANLEY picks up a strip of paper.
MCCANN moves in.) Mind that.
STANLEY. What is it?
MCCANN. Mind it. Leave it.
STANLEY. I've got a feeling we've met before.
MCCANN. No we haven't.
STANLEY. Ever been anywhere near Maidenhead?
MCCANN. No.
STANLEY. There's a Fuller's teashop. I used to have my tea there.
MCCANN. I don't know it.
STANLEY. And a Boots Library. I seem to connect you with the High Street.
MCCANN. Yes?
STANLEY. A charming town, don'i you think?
MCCANN. I don't know it.
STANLEY. Oh no. A quiet, thriving community. I was born and brought up there. I lived well away from the main road.
MCCANN. Yes?
Pause.
STANLEY. You're here on a short stay?
MCCANN. That's right.
STANLEY, You'll find it very bracing.
MCCANN. Do you find it bracing?
STANLEY. Me? No. But you will. (He sits at the table.) I like it here, but I'll be moving soon. Back home. I'll stay there too, this time. No place like home. (He laughs.) I wouldn't have left, but business calls. Business called, and I had to leave for a bit. You know how it is.
MCCANN (sitting at the table, left). You in business?
STANLEY. No. I think I'll give it up. I've got a small private income, you see. I think I'll give it up. Don't like being away from home. I used to live very quietly—-played records, that's about all. Everything delivered to the door. Then I started a little private business, in a small way, and it compelled me to come down here-kept me longer than I expected. You never get used to living in someone else's house. Don't you agree? I lived so quietly. You can only appreciate what you've had when things change. That's what they say, isn't it? Cigarette?
MCCANN. I don't smoke.
STANLEY lights a cigarette. Voices from the back.
STANLEY. Who's out there?
MCCANN. My friend and the man of the house.
STANLEY. You know what? To look at me, I bet you wouldn't think I'd led such a quiet life. The lines on my face, eh? It's the drink. Been drinking a bit down here. But what I mean is ... you know how it is ... away from your own ... all wrong, of course... I'll be all right when I get back ... but what I mean is, the way some people look at me you'd think I was a different person. I suppose I have changed, but I'm still the same man that I always was. I mean, you wouldn't think, to look at me, really ... I mean, not really, that I was the sort of bloke to—to cause any trouble, would you? (MCCANN looks at him.) Do you know what I mean?
MCCANN. No. (As STANLEY picks up a strip of paper.) Mind that.
STANLEY (quickly). Why are you down here?
35
MCCANN. A short holiday.
STANLEY. This is a ridiculous house to pick on. (He rises.)
MCCANN. Why?
STANLEY. Because it's not a boarding house. It never was.
MCCANN. Sure it is.
STANLEY. Why did you choose this house?
MCCANN. You know, sir, you're a bit depressed for a man on his birthday.
STANLEY (sharply). Why do you call me sir?
MCCANN. You don't like it?
STANLEY (to the table.) Listen. Don't call me sir.
MCCANN. I won't, if you don't like it.
STANLEY (moving away). No. Anyway, this isn't my birthday.
MCCANN. No?
STANLEY. No. It's not till next month.
MCCANN. Not according to the lady.
STANLEY. Her? She's crazy. Round the bend.
MCCANN. That's a terrible thing to say.
STANLEY (to the table). Haven't you found that out yet?
There's a lot you don't know. I think someone's leading you up the garden path.
MCCANN. Who would do that?
STANLEY (leaning across the table). That woman is mad!
MCCANN. That's slander.
STANLEY. And you don't know what you're doing.
MCCANN. Your cigarette is near that paper.
Voices from the back.
STANLEY. Where the hell are they? (Stubbing his cigarette.)
Why don't they come in? What are they doing out there?
MCCANN. You want to steady yourself.
STANLEY crosses to him and grips his arm.
STANLEY (urgently). Look—
MCCANN. Don't touch me.
STANLEY. Look. Listen a minute.
MCCANN. Let go my arm.
STANLEY. Look. Sit down a minute.
MCCANN (savagely, hitting his arm). Don't do that!
STANLEY backs across the stage, holding his arm.
STANLEY. Listen. You knew what I was talking about before, didn't you?
MCCANN. I don't know what you're at at all.
STANLEY. It's a mistake! Do you understand?
MCCANN. You're in a bad state, man.
STANLEY (whispering, advancing). Has he told you anything?
Do you know what you're here for? Tell me. You needn't be frightened of me. Or hasn't he told you?
MCCANN. Told me what?
STANLEY (hissing). I've explained to you, damn you, that all those years I lived in Basingstoke I never stepped outside the door.
MCCANN. You know, I'm flabbergasted with you.
STANLEY (reasonably). Look. You look an honest man. You're being made a fool of, that's all. You understand? Where do you come from?
MCCANN. Where do you think?
STANLEY. I know Ireland very well. I've many friends there.
I love that country and I admire and trust its people. I trust them. They respect the truth and they have a sense of humour. I think their policemen are wonderful. I've been there. I've never seen such sunsets. What about coming out to have a drink with me? There's a pub down the road serves draught Guinness. Very difficult to get in these parts
—(He breaks off. The voices draw nearer. GOLDBERG and PETEY enter from the back door.)
GOLDBERG (as he enters). A mother in a million. (He sees STANLEY.) Ah.
PETEY. Oh hullo, Stan. You haven't met Stanley, have you, Mr Goldberg?
GOLDBERG. I haven't had the pleasure.
PETEY. Oh well, this is Mr Goldberg, this is Mr Webber.
GOLDBERG. Pleased to meet you.
PETEY. We were just getting a bit of air in the garden.
GOLDBERG. I was telling Mr Boles about my old mum. What days. (He sits at the table, right.) Yes. When I was a young-ster, of a Friday, I used to go for a walk down the canal with a girl who lived down my road. A beautiful girl. What a voice that bird had! A nightingale, my word of honour.
Good? Pure? She wasn't a Sunday school teacher for nothing. Anyway, I'd leave her with a little kiss on the cheek
-I never took liberties—we weren't like the young men these days in those days. We knew the meaning of respect.
So I'd give her a peck and I'd bowl back home. Humming away I'd be, past the children's playground. I'd tip my hat to the toddlers, I'd give a helping hand to a couple of stray dogs, everything came natural. I can see it like yesterday.
The sun falling behind the dog stadium. Ah! (He leans back contentedly.)
MCCANN. Like behind the town hall.
GOLDBERG. What town hall?
MCCANN. In Carrikmacross.
GOLDBERG. There's no comparison. Up the street, into my gate, inside the door, home. "Simey!" my old mum used to shout, "quick before it gets cold." And there on the table what would I see? The nicest piece of gefilte fish you could wish to find on a plate.
MCCANN. I thought your name was Nat.
GOLDBERG. She called me Simey.
PETEY. Yes, we all remember our childhood.
GOLDBERG. Too true. Eh, Mr Webber, what do you say?
Childhood. Hot water bottles. Hot milk. Pancakes. Soap suds. What a life.
Pause.
PETEY (rising from the table). Well, I'll have to be off.
GOLDBERG. Off?
PETEY. It's my chess night.
GOLDBERG. You're not staying for the party?
PETEY. No, I'm sorry, Stan. I didn't know about it till just now. And we've got a game on. I'll try and get back early.
GOLDBERG. We'll save some drink for you, all right? Oh, that reminds me. You'd better go and collect the bottles.
MCCANN. Now?
GOLDBERG. Of course, now. Time's getting on. Round the corner, remember? Mention my name.
PETEY. I'm coming your way.
GOLDBERG. Beat him quick and come back, Mr Boles.
PETEY. Do my best. See you later, Stan.
PETEY and MCCANN go out, left. STANLEY moves to the centre.
GOLDBERG. A warm night.
STANLEY (turning). Don't mess me about!
GOLDBERG. I beg your pardon?
STANLEY moving downstage). I'm afraid there's been a mis-take. We're booked out. Your room is taken. Mrs Boles forgot to tell you. You'll have to find somewhere else.
GOLDBERG. Are you the manager here?
STANLEY. That's right.
GOLDBERG. Is it a good game?
STANLEY. I run the house. I'm afraid you and your friend will have to find other accommodation.
GOLDBERG (rising). Oh, I forgot, I must congratulate you on your birthday. (Offering his hand.) Congratulations.
STANLEY (ignoring hand). Perhaps you're deaf.
GOLDBERG. No, what makes you think that? As a matter of fact, every single one of my senses is at its peak. Not bad going, eh? For a man past fifty. But a birthday, I always feel, is a great occasion, taken too much for granted these days.
What a thing to celebrate-birth! Like getting up in the morning. Marvellous! Some people don't like the idea of getting up in the morning. I've heard them. Getting up in the morning, they say, what is it? Your skin's crabby, you need a shave, your eyes are full of muck, your mouth is like a boghouse, the palms of your hands are full of sweat, your nose is clogged up, your feet stink, what are you but a corpse waiting to be washed? Whenever I hear that point of view I feel cheerful. Because I know what it is to wake up with the sun shining, to the sound of the lawnmower, all the little birds, the smell of the grass, church bells, tomato juice—
STANLEY. Get out.
Enter MCCANN, with bottles.
Get that drink out. These are unlicensed premises.
GOLDBERG. You're in a terrible humour today, Mr Webber.
And on your birthday too, with the good lady getting her strength up to give you a party.
MCCANN puts the bottles on the sideboard.
STANLEY. I told you to get those bottles out.
GOLDBERG. Mr Webber, sit down a minute.
STANLEY. Let me-just make this clear. You don't bother me.
To me, you're nothing but a dirty joke. But I have a responsibility towards the people in this house. They've been down here too long. They've lost their sense of smell. I haven't. And nobody's going to take advantage of them while I'm here. (A little less forceful.) Anyway, this house isn't your cup of tea. There's nothing here for you, from any angle, any angle. So why don't you just go, without any more fuss?
GOLDBERG. Mr Webber, sit down.
STANLEY. It's no good starting any kind of trouble.
GOLDBERG. Sit down.
STANLEY. Why should I?
GOLDBERG. If you want to know the truth, Webber, you're beginning to get on my breasts.
STANLEY. Really? Well, that's-
GOLDBERG. Sit down.
STANLEY. No.
GOLDBERG sighs, and sits at the table right.
GOLDBERG. McCann.
MCCANN. Nat?
GOLDBERG. Ask him to sit down.
MCCANN. Yes, Nat. (MCCANN moves to STANLEY.) Do you mind sitting down?
STANLEY. Yes, I do mind.
MCCANN. Yes now, but—it'd be better if you did.
STANLEY. Why don't you sit down?
MCCANN. No, not me-you.
STANLEY. No thanks.
Pause.
MCCANN. Nat.
GOLDBERG. What?
MCCANN. He won't sit down.
GOLDBERG. Well, ask him.
MCCANN. I've asked him.
GOLDBERG. Ask him again.
MCCANN (to STANLEY). Sit down.
STANLEY. Why?
MCCANN. You'd be more comfortable.
STANLEY. So would you.
Pause.
MCCANN. All right. If you will I will.
STANLEY. You first.
MCCANN slowly sits at the table, left
MCCANN. Well?
STANLEY. Right. Now you've both had a rest you can get out!
MCCAN (rising). That's a dirty trick T'l kick the shite out of GOLDBERG (rising). No! I have stood up.
MCCANN. Sit down again!
GOLDBERG. Once I'm up I'm up.
STANLEY. Same here.
MCCANN (moving to STANLEY). You've made Mr Goldberg stand up.
STANLEY (his voice rising). It'll do him good!
MCCANN. Get in that seat.
GOLDBERG. McCann.
MCCANN. Get down in that seat!
GOLDBERG (crossing to him). Webber. (Quietly.) SIT DOWN.
(Silence. STANLEY begins to whistle "The Mountains of Morne". He strolls casually to the chair at the table. They watch him. He stops whistling. Silence. He sits.)
STANLEY. You'd better be careful.
GOLDBERG. Webber, what were you doing yesterday?
STANLEY. Yesterday?
GOLDBERG. And the day before. What did you do the day before that?
STANLEY. What do you mean?
GOLDBERG. Why are you wasting everybody's time, Webber?
Why are you getting in everybody's way?
STANLEY. Me? What are you—
GOLDBERG. I'm telling you, Webber. You're a washout. Why are you getting on everybody's wick? Why are you driving that old lady off her conk?
MCCANN. He likes to do it!
GOLDBERG. Why do you behave so badly, Webber? Why do you force that old man out to play chess?
STANLEY. Me?
GOLDBERG. Why do you treat that young lady like a leper?
She's not the leper, Webber!
STANLEY. What the—
GOLDBERG. What did you wear last week, Webber? Where do you keep your suits?
MCCANN. Why did you leave the organization?
GOLDBERG. What would your old mum say, Webber?
MCCANN. Why did you betray us?
GOLDBERG. You hurt me, Webber. You're playing a dirty game.
MCCANN. That's a Black and Tan fact.
GOLDBERG. Who does he think he is?
MCCANN. Who do you think you are?
STANLEY. You're on the wrong horse.
GOLDBERG. When did you come to this place?
STANLEY. Last year.
GOLDBERG. Where did you come from?
STANLEY. Somewhere else.
GOLDBERG. Why did you come here?
STANLEY. My feet hurt!
GOLDBERG. Why did you stay?
STANLEY. I had a headache!
GOLDBERG. Did you take anything for it?
STANLEY. Yes.
GOLDBERG. What?
STANLEY. Fruit salts!
GOLDBERG. Enos or Andrews?
STANLEY. En— An—
GOLDBERG. Did you stir properly? Did they fizz?
STANLEY. Now, now, wait, you—
GOLDBERG. Did they fizz? Did they fizz or didn't they fizz?
MCCANN. He doesn't know!
GOLDBERG. You don't know. When did you last have a bath?
STANLEY. I have one every—
GOLDBERG. Don't lie.
MCCANN. You betrayed the organization. I know him!
STANLEY. You don't!
GOLDBERG. What can you see without your glasses?
STANLEY. Anything.
GOLDBERG. Take off his glasses.
MCCANN snatches his glasses and as STANLEY rises, reaching for them, takes his chair downstage centre, below the table, STANLEY stumbling as he follows. STANLEY clutches the chair and stays bent over it.
Webber, you're a fake. (They stand on each side of the chair.)
When did you last wash up a cup?
STANLEY. The Christmas before last.
GOLDBERG. Where?
STANLEY. Lyons Corner House.
GOLDBERG. Which one?
STANLEY. Marble Arch.
GOLDBERG. Where was your wife?
STANLEY. In—
GOLDBERG. Answer.
STANLEY (turning, crouched). What wife?
GOLDBERG. What have you done with your wife?
MCCANN. He's killed his wife!
GOLDBERG. Why did you kill your wife?
STANLEY (sitting, his back to the audience). What wife?
MCCANN. How did he kill her?
GOLDBERG. How did you kill her?
MCCANN. You throttled her.
GOLDBERG. With arsenic.
MCCANN. There's your man!
GOLDBERG. Where's your old mum?
STANLEY. In the sanatorium.
MCCANN. Yes!
GOLDBERG. Why did you never get married?
MCCANN. She was waiting at the porch.
GOLDBERG. You skeddadled from the wedding.
MCCANN. He left her in the lurch.
GOLDBERG. You left her in the pudding club.
MCCANN. She was waiting at the church.
GOLDBERG. Webber! Why did you change your name?
STANLEY. I forgot the other one.
GOLDBERG. What's your name now?
STANLEY. Joe Soap.
GOLDBERG. You stink of sin.
MCCANN. I can smell it.
GOLDBERG. Do you recognise an external force?
STANLEY. What?
GOLDBERG. Do you recognise an external force?
MCCANN. That's the question!
GOLDBERG. Do you recognise an external force, responsible for you, suffering for you?
STANLEY. It's late.
GOLDBERG. Late! Late enough! When did you last pray?
MCCANN. He's sweating!
GOLDBERG. When did you last pray?
MCCANN. He's sweating!
GOLDBERG. Is the number 846 possible or necessary?
STANLEY. Neither.
GOLDBERG. Wrong! Is the number 846 possible or necessary?
STANLEY. Both.
GOLDBERG. Wrong! It's necessary but not possible.
STANLEY. Both.
GOLDBERG. Wrong! Why do you think the number 846 is necessarily possible?
STANLEY. Must be.
GOLDBERG. Wrong! It's only necessarily necessary! We admit possibility only after we grant necessity. It is possible because necessary but by no means necessary through possibility.
The possibility can only be assumed after the proof of necessity.
MCCANN. Right!
GOLDBERG. Right? Of course right! We're right and you're wrong, Webber, all along the line.
MCCANN. All along the line!
GOLDBERG. Where is your lechery leading you?
MCCANN. You'll pay for this.
GOLDBERG. You stuff yourself with dry toast.
MCCANN. You contaminate womankind.
GOLDBERG. Why don't you pay the rent?
MCCANN. Mother defiler!
GOLDBERG. Why do you pick your nose?
MCCANN. I demand justice!
GOLDBERG. What's your trade?
MCCANN. What about Ireland?
GOLDBERG. What's your trade?
STANLEY. I play the piano.
GOLDBERG. How many fingers do you use?
STANLEY. No hands!
GOLDBERG. No society would touch you. Not even a building society.
MCCANN. You're a traitor to the cloth.
GOLDBERG. What do you use for pyjamas?
STANLEY. Nothing.
GOLDBERG. You verminate the sheet of your birth.
MCCANN. What about the Albigensenist heresy?
GOLDBERG. Who watered the wicket in Melbourne?
MCCANN. What about the blessed Oliver Plunkett?
GOLDBERG. Speak up, Webber. Why did the chicken cross the road?
STANLEY. He wanted to-he wanted to—he wanted to....
MCCANN. He doesn't know!
GOLDBERG. Why did the chicken cross the road?
STANLEY. He wanted to-he wanted to... • GOLDBERG. Why did the chicken cross the road?
STANLEY. He wanted....
MCCANN. He doesn't know. He doesn't know which came first!
GOLDBERG. Which came first?
MCCANN. Chicken? Egg? Which came first?
GOLDBERG and MCCANN. Which came first? Which came first? Which came first?
STANLEY screams.
GOLDBERG. He doesn't know. Do you know your own face?
MCCANN. Wake him up. Stick a needle in his eye.
GOLDBERG. You're a plague, Webber. You're an overthrow.
MCCANN. You're what's left!
GOLDBERG. But we've got the answer to you. We can sterilise you.
MCCANN. What about Drogheda?
GOLDBERG. Your bite is dead. Only your pong is left.
MCCANN. You betrayed our land.
GOLDBERG. You betray our breed.
MCCANN. Who are you, Webber?
GOLDBERG. What makes you think you exist?
MCCANN. You're dead.
GOLDBERG. You're dead. You can't live, you can't think, you can't love. You're dead. You're a plague gone bad. There's no juice in you. You're nothing but an odour!
Silence. They stand over him. He is crouched in the chair.
He looks up slowly and kicks GOLDBERG in the stomach.
GOLDBERG falls. STANLEY stands. MCCANN seizes a chair and lifts it above his head. STANLEY seizes a chair and covers his head with it. MCCANN and STANLEY circle.
GOLDBERG. Steady, McCann.
STANLEY (circling). Uuuuuhhhhh!
MCCANN. Right, Judas.
GOLDBERG (rising). Steady, McCann.
MCCANN. Come on!
STANLEY. Uuuuuuuhhhhh!
MCCANN. He's sweating.
STANLEY. Uuuuuhhhhh!
GOLDBERG. Easy, McCann.
MCCANN. The bastard sweatpig is sweating.
A loud drumbeat off left, descending the stairs. GOLDBERG takes the chair from STANLEY. They put the chairs down.
They stop still. Enter MEG, in evening dress, holding sticks and drum.
MEG. I brought the drum down. I'm dressed for the party.
GOLDBERG. Wonderful.
MEG. You like my dress?
GOLDBERG. Wonderful. Out of this world.
MEG. I know. My father gave it to me. (Placing drum on table.)
Doesn't it make a beautiful noise?
GOLDBERG. It's a fine piece of work. Maybe Stan'll play us a little tune afterwards.
MEG. Oh yes. Will you, Stan?
STANLEY. Could I have my glasses?
GOLDBERG. Ah yes. (He holds his hand out to MCCANN.
MCCANN passes him his glasses.) Here they are. (He holds them out for STANLEY, who reaches for them.) Here they are.
(STANLEY takes them.) Now. What have we got here?
Enough to scuttle a liner. We've got four bottles of Scotch and one bottle of Irish.
MEG. Oh, Mr Goldberg, what should I drink?
GOLDBERG. Glasses, glasses first. Open the Scotch, McCann.
MEG (at the sideboard). Here's my very best glasses in here.
MCCANN. I don't drink Scotch.
GOLDBERG. You've got the Irish.
MEG (bringing the glasses). Here they are.
GOLDBERG. Good. Mrs Boles, I think Stanley should pour the toast, don't you?
MEG. Oh yes. Come on, Stanley. (STANLEY walks slowly to the table.) Do you like my dress, Mr Goldberg?
GOLDBERG. It's out on its own. Turn yourself round a minute.
I used to be in the business. Go on, walk up there.
MEG. Oh no.
GOLDBERG. Don't be shy. (He slaps her bottom.)
MEG. Oooh!
GOLDBERG. Walk up the boulevard. Let's have a look at you, What a carriage. What's your opinion, McCann? Like a Countess, nothing less. Madam, now turn about and promenade to the kitchen. What a deportment!
MCCANN (to STANLEY). You can pour my Irish too.
GOLDBERG. You look like a Gladiola.
MEG. Stan, what about my dress?
GOLDBERG. One for the lady, one for the lady. Now madam-your glass.
MEG. Thank you.
GOLDBERG. Lift your glasses, ladies and gentlemen. We'll drink a toast.
MEG. Lulu isn't here.
GOLDBERG. It's past the hour. Now-who's going to propose the toast? Mrs Boles, it can only be you.
MEG. Me?
GOLDBERG. Who else?
MEG. But what do I say?
GOLDBERG. Say what you feel. What you honestly feel. (MEG looks uncertain.) It's Stanley's birthday. Your Stanley. Look at him. Look at him and it'll come. Wait a minute, the light's too strong. Let's have proper lighting. McCann, have you got your torch?
MCCANN (bringing a small torch from his pocket). Here.
GOLDBERG. Switch out the light and put on your torch.
(MCCANN goes to the door, switches off the light, comes back, shines the torch on MEG. Outside the window there is still a faint light.) Not on the lady, on the gentleman! You must shine it on the birthday boy. (MCCANN shines the torch in STANLEY's face.) Now, Mrs Boles, it's all yours.
Pause.
MEG. I don't know what to say.
GOLDBERG. Look at him. Just look at him.
MEG. Isn't the light in his eyes?
GOLDBERG. No, no. Go on.
MEG. Well-it's very, very nice to be here tonight, in my house, and I want to propose a toast to Stanley, because it's his birthday, and he's lived here for a long while now, and he's my Stanley now. And I think he's a good boy, although sometimes he's bad. (An appreciative laugh from GOLD-BERG.) And he's the only Stanley I know, and I know him better than all the world, although he doesn't think so.
("Hear—hear" from GOLDBERG.) Well, I could cry because I'm so happy, having him here and not gone away, on his birthday, and there isn't anything I wouldn't do for him, and all you good people here tonight.... (She sobs.)
GOLDBERG. Beautiful! A beautiful speech. Put the light on, McCann. (MCCANN goes to the door. STANLEY remains still.) That was a lovely toast. (The light goes on. LULU enters from the door, left. GOLDBERG comforts MEG.) Buck up now.
Come on, smile at the birdy. That's better. Ah, look who's here.
MEG. Lulu.
GOLDBERG. How do you do, Lulu? I'm Nat Goldberg.
LULU. Hallo.
GOLDBERG. Stanley, a drink for your guest. You just missed the toast, my dear, and what a toast.
LULU. Did I?
GOLDBERG. Stanley, a drink for your guest. Stanley. (STAN-LEY hands a glass to LULU.) Right. Now raise your glasses.
Everyone standing up? No, not you, Stanley. You must sit down.
MCCANN. Yes, that's right. He must sit down.
GOLDBERG. You don't mind sitting down a minute? We're going to drink to you.
MEG. Come on!
LULU. Come on!
STANLEY sits in a chair at the table.
GOLDBERG. Right. Now Stanley's sat down. (Taking the stage.) Well, I want to say first that I've never been so touched to the heart as by the toast we've just heard. How often, in this day and age, do you come across real, true warmth? Once in a lifetime. Until a few minutes ago, ladies and gentlemen, I, like all of you, was asking the same ques-tion. What's happened to the love, the bonhomie, the unashamed expression of affection of the day before yesterday, that our mums taught us in the nursery?
MCCANN. Gone with the wind.
GOLDBERG. That's what I thought, until today. I believe in a good laugh, a day's fishing, a bit of gardening. I was very proud of my old greenhouse, made out of my own spit and faith. That's the sort of man I am. Not size but quality. A little Austin, tea in Fullers, a library book from Boots, and I'm satisfied. But just now, I say just now, the lady of the house said her piece and I for one am knocked over by the sentiments she expressed. Lucky is the man who's at the receiving end, that's what I say. (Pause.) How can I put it to you? We all wander on our tod through this world. It's a lonely pillow to kip on. Right!
LULU (admiringly). Right!
GOLDBERG. Agreed. But tonight, Lulu, McCann, we've known a great fortune. We've heard a lady extend the sum total of her devotion, in all its pride, plume and peacock, to a member of her own living race. Stanley, my heartfelt congratulations. I wish you, on behalf of us all, a happy birthday. I'm sure you've never been a prouder man than you are today. Mazoltov! And may we only meet at Sim-chahs! (LULU and MEG applaud.) Turn out the light, Mc-Cann, while we drink the toast.
LULU. That was a wonderful speech.
MCCANN switches out the light, comes back, and shines the torch in STANLEY's face. The light ourside the window is fainter.
GOLDBERG. Lift your glasses. Stanley —happy birthday.
MCCANN. Happy birthday.
LULU. Happy birthday.
MEG. Many happy returns of the day, Stan.
GOLDBERG. And well over the fast.
They all drink.
MEG (kissing him. Oh, Stanny....
GOLDBERG. Lights!
MCCANN. Right! (He switches on the lights.)
MEG. Clink my glass, Stan.
LULU. Mr Goldberg—
GOLDBERG. Call me Nat.
MEG (to MCCANN). You clink my glass.
LULU (t GOLDBERG). You're empty. Let me fill you up.
GOLDBERG. It's a pleasure.
LULU. You're a marvellous speaker, Nat, you know that?
Where did you learn to speak like that?
GOLDBERG. You liked it, eh?
LULU. Oh yes!
GOLDBERG. Well, my first chance to stand up and give a lecture was at the Ethical Hall, Bayswater. A wonderful opportunity. I'll never forget it. They were all there that night. Charlotte Street was empty. Of course, that's a good while ago.
LULU. What did you speak about?
GOLDBERG. The Necessary and the Possible. It went like a bomb. Since then I always speak at weddings.
STANLEY is still. GOLDBERG sits left of the table. MEG joins MCCANN downstage, right, LULU is downstage, left.
MCCANN pours more Irish from the bottle, which he carries, into his glass.
MEG. Let's have some of yours.
MCCANN. In that?
MEG. Yes.
MCCANN. Are you used to mixing them?
MEG. No.
MCCANN. Give me your glass.
MEG sits on a shoe-box, downstage, right. LULU, at the table, pours more drink for GOLDBERG and herself, and gives GOLDBERG his glass.
GOLDBERG. Thank you.
MEG (to MCCANN). Do you think I should?
GOLDBERG. Lulu, you're a big bouncy girl. Come and sit on my lap.
MCCANN. Why not?
LULU. Do you think I should?
GOLDBERG. Try it.
MEG (sipping). Very nice.
LULU. I'll bounce up to the ceiling.
MCCANN. I don't know how you can mix that stuff.
GOLDBERG. Take a chance.
MEG (to MCCANN). Sit down on this stool.
LULU sits on GOLDBERG's lap.
MCCANN. This?
GOLDBERG. Comfortable?
LULU. Yes thanks.
MCCANN (sitting). It's comfortable.
GOLDBERG. You know, there's a lot in your eyes.
LULU. And in yours, too.
GOLDBERG. Do you think so?
LULU (giggling). Go on!
MCCANN (to MEG). Where'd you get it?
MEG. My father gave it to me.
LULU. I didn't know I was going to meet you here tonight.
MCCANN (to MEG). Ever been to Carrikmacross?
MEG (drinking). I've been to King's Cross.
LULU. You came right out of the blue, you know that?
GOLDBERG (as she moves). Mind how you go. You're cracking a rib.
MEG (standing). I want to dance! (LULU and GOLDBERG look into each other's eyes. MCCANN drinks. MEG crosses to STANLEY). Stanley. Dance. (STANLEY sits still. MEG dances round the room alone, then comes back to MCCANN, who fills her glass. She sits.)
LULU (to GOLDBERG). Shall I tell you something?
GOLDBERG. What?
LULU. I trust you.
GOLDBERG (lifting his glass). Gesundheit.
LULU. Have you got a wife?
GOLDBERG. I had a wife. What a wife. Listen to this. Friday, of an afternoon, I'd take myself for a little constitutional, down over the park. Eh, do me a favour, just sit on the table a minute, will you? (LULU sits on the table. He stretches and continues.) A little constitutional. I'd say hullo to the little boys, the little girls-I never made distinctions- and then back I'd go, back to my bungalow with the flat roof. "Simey," my wife used to shout, "quick, before it gets cold!" And there on the table what would I see? The nicest piece of rollmop and pickled cucumber you could wish to find on a plate, LULU. I thought your name was Nat.
GOLDBERG. She called me Simey.
LULU. I bet you were a good husband.
GOLDBERG. You should have seen her funeral.
LULU. Why?
GOLDBERG draws in his breath and wags head). What a funeral.
MEG (to MCCANN). My father was going to take me to Ireland once. But then he went away by himself.
LULU (to GOLDBERG. Do you think you knew me when I was a little girl?
GOLDBERG. Were you a nice little girl?
LULU. I was.
MEG. I don't know if he went to Ireland.
GOLDBERG. Maybe I played piggy-back with you.
LULU. Maybe you did.
MEG. He didn't take me.
GOLDBERG. Or pop goes the weasel.
LULU. Is that a game?
GOLDBERG. Sure it's a game!
MCCANN. Why didn't he take you to Ireland?
LULU. You're tickling me!
GOLDBERG. You should worry.
LULU. I've always liked older men. They can soothe you.
They embrace.
MCCANN. I know a place. Roscrea. Mother Nolan's.
MEG. There was a night-light in my room, when I was a little girl.
MCCANN. One time I stayed there all night with the boys.
Singing and drinking all night.
MEG. And my Nanny used to sit up with me, and sing songs
to me.
MCCANN. And a plate of fry in the morning. Now where am I?
MEG. My little room was pink. I had a pink carpet and pink curtains, and I had musical boxes all over the room. And they played me to sleep. And my father was a very big doctor. That's why I never had any complaints. I was cared for, and I had little sisters and brothers in other rooms, all different colours.
MCCANN. Tullamore, where are you?
MEG (to MCCANN). Give us a drop more.
MCCANN (filling her glass and singing). Glorio, Glorio, to the bold Fenian men!
MEG. Oh, what a lovely voice.
GOLDBERG. Give us a song, McCann.
LULU. A love song!
MCCANN (reciting). The night that poor Paddy was stretched, the boys they all paid him a visit.
GOLDBERG. A love song!
MCCANN (in a full voice, sings)
Oh, the Garden of Eden has vanished, they say, But I know the lie of it still.
Just turn to the left at the foot of Ben Clay And stop when halfway to Coote Hill.
It's there you will find it, I know sure enough, And it's whispering over to me:
Come back, Paddy Reilly, to Bally-James-Duft, Come home, Paddy Reilly, to me!
LULU (to GOLDBERG. You're the dead image of the first man I ever loved.
GOLDBERG. It goes without saying.
MEG (rising). I want to play a game!
GOLDBERG. A game?
LULU. What game?
MEG. Any game.
LULU (jumping up). Yes, let's play a game.
GOLDBERG. What game?
MCCANN. Hide and seek.
LULU. Blind man's buff.
MEG. Yes!
GOLDBERG. You want to play blind man's buff?
LULU and MEG. Yes!
GOLDBERG. All right. Blind man's buff. Come on! Everyone up! (Rising.) McCann. Stanley-Stanley!
MEG. Stanley. Up.
GOLDBERG. What's the matter with him?
MEG (bending over him). Stanley, we're going to play a game.
Oh, come on, don't be sulky, Stan.
LULU. Come on.
STANLEY riseS. MCCANN rises.
GOLDBERG. Right! Now-who's going to be blind first?
LULU. Mrs Boles.
MEG. Not me.
GOLDBERG. Of course you.
MEG. Who, me?
LULU (taking her scarf from her neck). Here you are.
MCCANN. How do you play this game?
LULU (tying her scarf round MEG's eyes). Haven't you ever played blind man's buff? Keep still, Mrs Boles. You mustn't be touched. But you can't move after she's blind.
You must stay where you are after she's blind. And if she touches you then you become blind. Turn round. How many fingers am I holding up?
MEG. I can't see.
LULU. Right.
GOLDBERG. Right! Everyone move about. McCann. Stanley.
Now stop. Now still. Off you go!
STANLEY is downstage, right, MEG moves about the room.
GOLDBERG fondles LULU at arm's length. MEG touches MCCANN.
MEG. Caught you!
LULU. Take of your scarf.
MEG. What lovely hair!
LULU (untying the scarf). There.
MEG. It's you!
GOLDBERG. Put it on, McCann.
LULU (tying it on MCCANN). There. Turn round. How many fingers am I holding up?
MCCANN. I don't know.
GOLDBERG. Right! Everyone move about. Right. Stop! Still!
MCCANN begins to move.
MEG. Oh, this is lovely!
GOLDBERG. Quiet! Tch, tch, tch. Now-all move again.
Stop! Still!
MCCANN moves about. GOLDBERG fondles LULU at arm's length. MCCANN draws near STANLEY. He stretches his arm and touches STANLEY's glasses.
MEG. It's Stanley!
GOLDBERG (to LULU). Enjoying the game?
MEG. It's your turn, Stan.
MCCANN takes off the scarf.
MCCANN (to STANLEY). I'll take your glasses.
MCCANN takes STANLEY'S glasses.
MEG. Give me the scarf.
GOLDBERG holding LULU). Tie his scarf, Mrs. Boles.
MEG. That's what I'm doing. (To STANLEY.) Can you see my nose?
GOLDBERG. He can't. Ready? Right! Everyone move. Stop!
And still!
STANLEY stands blindfold. MCCANN backs slowly across the stage to the left. He breaks STANLEY's glasses, snapping the frames. MEG is downstage, left, LULU and GOLDBERG upstage centre, close together. STANLEY begins to move, very slowly, across the stage to the left. MCCANN picks up the drum and places it sideways in STANLEY'S path. STANLEY walks into the drum and falls over with his foot caught in it.
MEG. Ooh!
GOLDBERG. Sssh!
STANLEY rises. He begins to move towards MEG, dragging the drum on his foot. He reaches her and stops. His hands
move towards her and they reach her throat. He begins to strangle her. MCCANN and GOLDBERG rush forward and throw him off.
BLACKOUT
There is now no light at all through the window. The stage is in darkness.
LULU. The lights!
GOLDBERG. What's happened?
LULU. The lights!
MCCANN. Wait a minute.
GOLDBERG. Where is he?
MCCANN. Let go of me!
GOLDBERG. Who's this?
LULU. Someone's touching me!
MCCANN. Where is he?
MEG. Why has the light gone out?
GOLDBERG. Where's your torch? (MCCANN shines the torch in GOLDBERG'S face.) Not on me! (MCCANN shifts the torch.
It is knocked from his hand and falls. It goes out.)
MCCANN. My torch!
LULU. Oh God!
GOLDBERG. Where's your torch? Pick up your torch!
MCCANN. I can't find it.
LULU. Hold me. Hold me.
GOLDBERG. Get down on your knees. Help him find the torch.
LULU. I can't.
MCCANN. It's gone.
MEG. Why has the light gone out?
GOLDBERG. Everyone quiet! Help him find the torch.
Silence. Grunts from MCCANN and GOLDBERG on their knees. Suddenly there is a sharp, sustained rat-a-tat with a stick on the side of the drum from the back of the room.
Silence. Whimpers from LULU.
GOLDBERG. Over here. McCann!
MCCANN. Here.
GOLDBERG. Come to me, come to me. Easy. Over there.
GOLDBERG and MCCANN move up left of the table.
STANLEY moves down right of the table. LULU suddenly perceives him moving towards her, screams and faints.
GOLDBERG and MCCANN turn and stumble against each other.
GOLDBERG. What is it?
MCCANN. Who's that?
GOLDBERG. What is it?
In the darkness STANLEY picks up LULU and places her on the table.
MEG. It's Lulu!
GOLDBERG and MCCANN move downstage, right.
GOLDBERG. Where is she?
MCCANN. She fell.
GOLDBERG. Where?
MCCANN. About here.
GOLDBERG. Help me pick her up.
MCCANN (moving downstage, left). I can't find her.
GOLDBERG. She must be somewhere.
MCCANN. She's not here.
GOLDBERG (moving downstage, left). She must be.
MCCANN. She's gone.
MCCANN finds the torch on the floor, shines it on the table and STANLEY. LULU is lying spread-eagled on the table, STANLEY bent over her. STANLEY, as soon as the torchlight hits him, begins to giggle. GOLDBERG and MCCANN move cowards him. He backs, giggling, the torch on his face. They follow him upstage, left. He backs against the hatch, giggling.
The torch draws closer. His giggle rises and grows as he flarrens himself against the wall. Their figures converge upon ham.
Curtain
Act Three
The next morning. PETEY enters, left, with a newspaper and sits ar the table. He begins to read. MEG's voice comes through the kitchen hatch.
MEG. Is that you, Stan? (Pause.) Stanny?
PETEY. Yes?
MEG. Is that you?
PETEY. It's me.
MEG (appearing at the hatch). Oh, it's you. I've run out of cornflakes.
PETEY. Well, what else have you got?
MEG. Nothing.
PETEY. Nothing?
MEG. Just a minute. (She leaves the hatch and enters by the kitchen door.) You got your paper?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. Is it good?
PETEY. Not bad.
MEG. The two gentlemen had the last of the fry this morn-ing.
PETEY. Oh, did they?
MEG. There's some tea in the pot though. (She pours tea for him.) I'm going out shopping in a minute. Get you something nice. I've got a splitting headache.
PETEY (reading). You slept like a log last night.
MEG. Did I?
PETEY. Dead out.
MEG. I must have been tired. (She looks abour the room and sees the broken drum in the fireplace.) Oh, look. (She rises and picks it up.) The drum's broken. (PETEY looks up.) Why is it broken?
PETEY. I don't know.
She hits it with her hand.
MEG. It still makes a noise.
PETEY. You can always get another one.
MEG (sadly). It was probably broken in the party. I don't remember it being broken though, in the party. (She purs it down.) What a shame.
PETEY. You can always get another one, Meg.
MEG. Well, at least he did have it on his birthday, didn't he?
Like I wanted him to.
PETEY (reading). Yes.
MEG. Have you seen him down yet? (PETEY does not answer.)
Petey•
PETEY. What?
MEG. Have you seen him down?
PETEY. Who?
MEG. Stanley.
PETEY. No.
MEG. Nor have I. That boy should be up. He's late for his breakfast.
PETEY. There isn't any breakfast.
MEG. Yes, but he doesn't know that. I'm going to call him.
PETEY (quickly). No, don't do that, Meg. Let him sleep.
MEG. But you say he stays in bed too much.
PETEY. Let him sleep... this morning. Leave him.
MEG. I've been up once, with his cup of tea. But Mr McCann opened the door. He said they were talking. He said he'd made him one. He must have been up early. I don't know what they were talking about. I was surprised. Because Stanley's usually fast asleep when I wake him. But he wasn't this morning. I heard him talking. (Pause.) Do you think they know each other? I think they're old friends.
Stanley had a lot of friends. I know he did. (Pause.) I didn't give him his tea. He'd already had one. I came down again and went on with my work. Then, after a bit, they came down to breakfast. Stanley must have gone to sleep again.
Pause.
PETEY. When are you going to do your shopping, Meg?
MEG. Yes, I must. (Collecting the bag.) I've got a rotten head-ache. (She goes to the back door, stops suddenly and turns.)
Did you see what's outside this morning?
PETEY. What?
MEG. That big car.
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. It wasn't there yesterday. Did you ... did you have a look inside it?
PETEY. I had a peep.
MEG (coming down tensely, and whispering). Is there anything in it?
PETEY. In it?
MEG. Yes.
PETEY. What do you mean, in it?
MEG. Inside it.
PETEY. What sort of thing?
MEG. Well... I mean... is there... is there a wheelbarrow in it?
PETEY. A wheelbarrow?
MEG. Yes.
PETEY. I didn't see one.
MEG. You didn't? Are you sure?
PETEY. What would Mr Goldberg want with a wheelbarrow?
MEG. Mr Goldberg?
PETEY. It's his car.
MEG (relieved). His car? Oh, I didn't know it was his car.
PETEY. Of course it's his car.
MEG. Oh, I feel better.
PETEY. What are you on about?
MEG. Oh, I do feel better.
PETEY. You go and get a bit of air.
MEG. Yes, I will. I will. I'll go and get the shopping. (She goes towards the back door. A door slams upstairs. She turns.) It's Stanley! He's coming down-what am I going to do about his breakfast? (She rushes into the kitchen.) Petey, what shall I give him? (She looks through the hatch.) There's no corn-flakes. (They both gaze at the door. Enter GOLDBERG. He halts ar the door, as he meets their gaze, then smiles.)
GOLDBERG. A reception committee!
MEG. Oh, I thought it was Stanley.
GOLDBERG. You find a resemblance?
MEG. Oh no. You look quite different.
GOLDBERG (coming into the room). Different build, of course.
MEG (entering from the kitchen). I thought he was coming down for his breakfast. He hasn't had his breakfast yet.
GOLDBERG. Your wife makes a very nice cup of tea, Mr Boles, you know that?
PETEY. Yes, she does sometimes. Sometimes she forgets.
MEG. Is he coming down?
GOLDBERG. Down? Of course he's coming down. On a lovely sunny day like this he shouldn't come down? He'll be up and about in next to no time. (He sits at the table.) And what a breakfast he's going to get.
MEG. Mr Goldberg.
GOLDBERG. Yes?
MEG. I didn't know that was your car outside.
GOLDBERG. You like it?
MEG. Are you going to go for a ride?
GOLDBERG (LO PETEY). A smart car, eh?
PETEY. Nice shine on it all right.
GOLDBERG. What is old is good, take my tip. There's room there. Room in the front, and room in the back. (He strokes the teapor.) The pot's hot. More tea, Mr Boles?
PETEY. No thanks.
GOLDBERG (pouring tea). That car? That car's never let me down.
MEG. Are you going to go for a ride?
GOLDBERG does not answer, drinks his tea.
MEG. Well, I'd better be off now. (She moves to the back door, and turns.) Petey, when Stanley comes down....
PETEY. Yes?
MEG. Tell him I won't be long.
PETEY. I'll tell him.
MEG (vaguely). I won't be long. (She exits.)
GOLDBERG (sipping his tea. A good woman. A charming woman. My mother was the same. My wife was identical.
PETEY. How is he this morning?
GOLDBERG. Who?
PETEY. Stanley. Is he any better?
GOLDBERG (a little uncertainly). Oh ... a little better, I think, a little better. Of course, I'm not really qualified to say, Mr Boles. I mean, I haven't got the ... the quali-fications. The best thing would be if someone with the proper... mon... qualifications ... was to have a look at him. Someone with a few letters after his name. It makes all the difference.
PETEY. Yes.
GOLDBERG. Anyway, Dermot's with him at the moment.
He's ... keeping him company.
PETEY. Dermot?
GOLDBERG. Yes.
PETEY. It's a terrible thing.
GOLDBERG (sighs). Yes. The birthday celebration was too much for him.
PETEY. What came over him?
GOLDBERG (sharply). What came over him? Breakdown, Mr Boles. Pure and simple. Nervous breakdown.
PETEY. But what brought it on so suddenly?
GOLDBERG (rising, and moving upstage). Well, Mr Boles, it can happen in all sorts of ways. A friend of mine was telling me about it only the other day. We'd both been concerned with another case-not entirely similar, of course, but ... quite alike, quite alike. (He pauses.) Anyway, he was telling me, you see, this friend of mine, that sometimes it happens gradual-day by day it grows and grows and grows day by day. And then other times it happens all at once.
Poof! Like that! The nerves break. There's no guarantee how it's going to happen, but with certain people... it's a foregone conclusion.
PETEY. Really?
GOLDBERG. Yes. This friend of mine—he was telling me about it—only the other day. (He stands uneasily for a moment, then brings out a cigarette case and takes a cigarette.)
Have an Abdullah.
PETEY. No, no, I don't take them.
GOLDBERG. Once in a while I treat myself to a cigarette. An Abdullah, perhaps, or a ... (He snaps his fingers.)
PETEY. What a night. (GOLDBERG lights his cigarette with a lighter.) Came in the front door and all the lights were out.
Put a shilling in the slot, came in here and the party was over.
GOLDBERG (coming downstage). You put a shilling in the slot?
PETEY. Yes.
GOLDBERG. And the lights came on.
PETEY. Yes, then I came in here.
GOLDBERG (with a short laugh). I could have sworn it was a fuse.
PETEY (continuing). There was dead silence. Couldn't hear a thing. So I went upstairs and your friend-Dermot-met me on the landing. And he told me.
GOLDBERG (sharply). Who?
PETEY. Your friend-Dermot.
GOLDBERG (heavily). Dermot. Yes. (He sits.)
PETEY. They get over it sometimes though, don't they? I mean, they can recover from it, can't they?
GOLDBERG. Recover? Yes, sometimes they recover, in one way or another.
PETEY. I mean, he might have recovered by now, mightn't he?
GOLDBERG. It's conceivable. Conceivable.
PETEY rises and picks up the teapot and cup.
PETEY. Well, if he's no better by lunchtime I'll go and get hold of a doctor.
GOLDBERG (briskly). It's all taken care of, Mr Boles. Don't worry yourself.
PETEY (dubiously). What do you mean? (Enter MCCANN with two suitcases.) All packed up?
PETEY takes the teapot and cups into the kitchen. MCCANN crosses left and puts down the suitcases. He goes up to the window and looks out.
GOLDBERG. Well? (MCCANN does not answer.) McCann. I asked you well.
MCCANN (without turning). Well what?
GOLDBERG. What's what? (MCCANN does not answer.)
MCCANN (turning to look at GOLDBERG, grimly). I'm not going up there again.
GOLDBERG. Why not?
MCCANN. I'm not going up there again.
GOLDBERG. What's going on now?
MCCANN (moving down). He's quiet now. He stopped all that ... talking a while ago.
PETEY appears at the kitchen hatch, unnoticed.
GOLDBERG. When will he be ready?
MCCANN (sullenly). You can go up yourself next time.
GOLDBERG. What's the matter with you?
MCCANN (quietly). I gave him....
GOLDBERG. What?
MCCANN. I gave him his glasses.
GOLDBERG. Wasn't he glad to get them back?
MCCANN. The frames are bust.
GOLDBERG. How did that happen?
MCCANN. He tried to fit the eyeholes into his eyes. I left him doing it.
PETEY (at the kitchen door). There's some Sellotape some-where. We can stick them together.
GOLDBERG and MCCANN turn to see him. Pause.
GOLDBERG. Sellotape? No, no, that's all right, Mr Boles.
It'll keep him quiet for the time being, keep his mind off other things.
PETEY moving downstage). What about a doctor?
GOLDBERG. It's all taken care of.
MCCANN moves over right to the shoe-box, and takes out a brush and brushes his shoes.
PETEY (moves to the table). I think he needs one.
GOLDBERG. I agree with you. It's all taken care of. We'll give him a bit of time to settle down, and then I'll take him to Monty.
PETEY. You're going to take him to a doctor?
GOLDBERG (staring at him). Sure. Monty.
Pause. MCCANN brushes his shoes.
So Mrs Boles has gone out to get us something nice for lunch?
PETEY. That's right.
GOLDBERG. Unfortunately we may be gone by then.
PETEY. Will you?
GOLDBERG. By then we may be gone.
Pause.
PETEY. Well, I think I'll see how my peas are getting on, in the meantime.
GOLDBERG. The meantime?
PETEY. While we're waiting.
GOLDBERG. Waiting for what? (PETEY walks towards the back door.) Aren't you going back to the beach?
PETEY. No, not yet. Give me a call when he comes down, will you, Mr Goldberg?
GOLDBERG (earnestly). You'll have a crowded beach today ... on a day like this. They'll be lying on their backs, swimming out to sea. My life. What about the deck-chairs?
Are the deck-chairs ready?
PETEY. I put them all out this morning.
GOLDBERG. But what about the tickets? Who's going to take the tickets?
PETEY. That's all right. That'll be all right. Mr Goldberg.
Don't you worry about that. I'll be back.
He exits. GOLDBERG rises, goes to the window and looks after him. MCCANN crosses to the table, left, sits, picks up the paper and begins to tear it into strips.
GOLDBERG. Is everything ready?
MCCANN. Sure.
GOLDBERG walks heavily, brooding, to the table. He sits right of it noticing what MCCANN is doing.
GOLDBERG. Stop doing that!
MCCANN. What?
GOLDBERG. Why do you do that all the time? It's childish, it's pointless. It's without a solitary point.
MCCANN. What's the matter with you today?
GOLDBERG. Questions, questions. Stop asking me so many questions. What do you think I am?
MCCANN studies him. He then folds the paper, leaving the strips inside.
MCCANN. Well?
Pause. GOLDBERG leans back in the chair, his eyes closed.
MCCANN. Well?
GOLDBERG (with fatigue). Well what?
MCCANN. Do we wait or do we go and get him?
GOLDBERG (slowly). You want to go and get him?
MCCANN. I want to get it over.
GOLDBERG. That's understandable.
MCCANN. So do we wait or do we go and get him?
GOLDBERG (interrupting). I don't know why, but I feel knocked out. I feel a bit... It's uncommon for me.
MCCANN. Is that so?
GOLDBERG. It's unusual.
MCCANN (rising swiftly and going behind GOLDBERG's chair.
Hissing). Let's finish and go. Let's get it over and go. Get the thing done. Let's finish the bloody thing. Let's get the thing done and go!
Pause.
Will I go up?
Pause.
Nat!
GOLDBERG sits humped. MCCANN slips to his side.
Simey!
GOLDBERG (opening his eyes, regarding MCCANN). What-did
—you-call-me?
MCCANN. Who?
GOLDBERG (murderously). Don't call me that! (He seizes
MCCANN by the throat.) NEVER CALL ME THAT!
MCCANN (writhing). Nat, Nat, Nat, NAT! I called you Nat. I was asking you, Nat. Honest to God. Just a question, that's all, just a question, do you see, do you follow me?
GOLDBERG (jerking him away). What question?
MCCANN. Will I go up?
GOLDBERG (violently). Up? I thought you weren't going to go up there again?
MCCANN. What do you mean? Why not?
GOLDBERG. You said so!
MCCANN. I never said that!
GOLDBERG. No?
MCCANN (from the floor, to the room at large). Who said that? I never said that! I'll go up now!
He jumps up and rushes to the door, left.
GOLDBERG. Wait!
He stretches his arms to the arms of the chair.
Come here.
MCCANN approaches him very slowly.
I want your opinion. Have a look in my mouth.
He opens his mouth wide.
Take a good look.
MCCANN looks.
You know what I mean?
MCCANN peers.
You know what? I've never lost a tooth. Not since the day I was born. Nothing's changed. (He gets up.) That's why I've reached my position, McCann. Because I've always been as fit as a fiddle. All my life I've said the same. Play up, play up, and play the game. Honour thy father and thy mother.
All along the line. Follow the line, the line, McCann, and you can't go wrong. What do you think, I'm a self-made man? No! I sat where I was told to sit. I kept my eye on the ball. School? Don't talk to me about school. Top in all subjects. And for why? Because I'm telling you, I'm telling you, follow my line? Follow my mental? Learn by heart. Never write down a thing. And don't go too near the water.
And you'll find —that what I say is true.
Because I believe that the world... (Vacant.)...
Because I believe that the world ... (Desperate.)....
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD. • • (Lost.)....
He sits in chair.
Sit down, McCann, sit here where I can look at you.
MCCANN kneels in front of the table.
(Intensely, with growing certainty.) My father said to me, Benny, Benny, he said, come here. He was dying. I knelt down. By him day and night. Who else was there? Forgive, Benny, he said, and let live. Yes, Dad. Go home to your wife.
I will, Dad. Keep an eye open for low-lives, for schnorrers and for layabouts. He didn't mention names. I lost my life in the service of others, he said, I'm not ashamed. Do your duty and keep your observations. Always bid good morning to the neighbours. Never, never forget your family, for they are the rock, the constitution and the core! If you're ever in any difficulties Uncle Barney will see you in the clear. I knelt down. (He kneels, facing MCCANN.) I swore on the good book. And I knew the word I had to remember-Respect!
Because McCann— (Gently.) Seamus—who came before your father? His father. And who came before him? Before him? ... (Vacant-triumphant.) Who came before your father's father but your father's father's mother! Your great-gran-granny.
Silence. He slowly rises.
And that's why I've reached my position, McCann. Because I've always been as fit as a fiddle. My motto. Work hard and play hard. Not a day's illness.
GOLDBERG sits.
GOLDBERG. All the same, give me a blow. (Pause.) Blow in my mouth.
MCCANN stands, puts his hands on his knees, bends, and blows in GOLDBERG'S mouth.
One for the road.
MCCANN blows again in his mouth. GOLDBERG breathes deeply, smiles.
GOLDBERG. Right!
Enter LULU. MCCANN looks at them, and goes to the door.
MCCANN (at the door). I'll give you five minutes. (He exits.)
GOLDBERG. Come over here.
LULU. What's going to happen?
GOLDBERG. Come over here.
LULU. No, thank you.
GOLDBERG. What's the matter? You got the needle to Uncle Natey?
LULU. I'm going.
GOLDBERG. Have a game of pontoon first, for old time's sake.
LULU. I've had enough games.
GOLDBERG. A girl like you, at your age, at your time of health, and you don't take to games?
LULU. You're very smart.
GOLDBERG. Anyway, who says you don't take to them?
LULU. Do you think I'm like all the other girls?
GOLDBERG. Are all the other girls like that, too?
LULU. I don't know about any other girls.
GOLDBERG. Nor me. I've never touched another woman.
LULU (distressed). What would my father say, if he knew? And what would Eddie say?
GOLDBERG. Eddie?
LULU. He was my first love, Eddie was. And whatever hap-pened, it was pure. With him! He didn't come into my room at night with a briefcase!
GOLDBERG. Who opened the briefcase, me or you? Lulu, schmulu, let bygones be bygones, do me a turn. Kiss and make up.
LULU. I wouldn't touch you.
GOLDBERG. And today I'm leaving.
LULU. You're leaving?
GOLDBERG. Today.
LULU (with growing anger). You used me for a night. A passing fancy.
GOLDBERG. Who used who?
LULU. You made use of me by cunning when my defences were down.
GOLDBERG. Who took them down?
LULU. That's what you did. You quenched your ugly thirst.
You taught me things a girl shouldn't know before she's been married at least three times!
GOLDBERG. Now you're a jump ahead! What are you complaining about?
Enter MCCANN quickly.
LULU. You didn't appreciate me for myself. You took all those liberties only to satisfy your appetite. Oh Nat, why did you do it?
GOLDBERG. You wanted me to do it, Lulula, so I did it.
MCCANN. That's fair enough. (Advancing.) You had a long sleep, Miss.
LULU (backing upstage left). Me?
MCCANN. Your sort, you spend too much time in bed.
LULU. What do you mean?
MCCANN. Have you got anything to confess?
LULU. What?
MCCANN (savagely). Confess!
LULU. Confess what?
MCCANN. Down on your knees and confess!
LULU. What does he mean?
GOLDBERG. Confess. What can you lose?
LULU. What, to him?
GOLDBERG. He's only been unfrocked six months.
MCCANN. Kneel down, woman, and tell me the latest!
LULU (retreating to the back door). I've seen everything that's happened. I know what's going on. I've got a pretty shrewd idea.
MCCANN (advancing). I've seen you hanging about the Rock of Cashel, profaning the soil with your goings-on. Out of my sight!
LULU. I'm going.
She exits. MCCANN goes to the door, left, and goes our. He ushers in STANLEY, who is dressed in a dark well cut sut and white collar. He holds his broken glasses in his hand.
He is clean-shaven. MCCANN follows and closes the door.
GOLDBERG meets STANLEY, seats him in a chair.
GOLDBERG. How are you, Stan?
Pause.
Are you feeling any better?
Pause.
What's the matter with your glasses?
GOLDBERG bends to look.
They're broken. A pity.
STANLEY stares blankly at the floor.
MCCANN (at the table). He looks better, doesn't he?
GOLDBERG. Much better.
MCCANN. A new man.
GOLDBERG. You know what we'll do?
MCCANN. What?
GOLDBERG. We'll buy him another pair.
They begin to woo him, gently and with relish. During the following sequence STANLEY shows no reaction. He remains, with no movement, where he sits.
MCCANN. Out of our own pockets.
GOLDBERG. It goes without saying. Between you and me, Stan, it's about time you had a new pair of glasses.
MCCANN. You can't see straight.
GOLDBERG. It's true. You've been cockeyed for years.
MCCANN. Now you're even more cockeyed.
GOLDBERG. He's right. You've gone from bad to worse.
MCCANN. Worse than worse.
GOLDBERG. You need a long convalescence.
MCCANN. A change of air.
GOLDBERG. Somewhere over the rainbow.
MCCANN. Where angels fear to tread.
GOLDBERG. Exactly.
MCCANN. You're in a rut.
GOLDBERG. You look anaemic.
MCCANN. Rheumatic.
GOLDBERG. Myopic.
MCCANN. Epileptic.
GOLDBERG. You're on the verge.
MCCANN. You're a dead duck.
GOLDBERG. But we can save you.
MCCANN. From a worse fate.
GOLDBERG. True.
MCCANN. Undeniable.
GOLDBERG. From now on, we'll be the hub of your wheel.
MCCANN. We'll renew your season ticket.
GOLDBERG. We'll take tuppence off your morning tea.
MCCANN. We'll give you a discount on all inflammable goods.
GOLDBERG. We'll watch over you.
MCCANN. Advise you.
GOLDBERG. Give you proper care and treatment.
MCCANN. Let you use the club bar.
GOLDBERG. Keep a table reserved.
MCCANN. Help you acknowledge the fast days.
GOLDBERG. Bake you cakes.
MCCANN. Help you kneel on kneeling days.
GOLDBERG. Give you a free pass.
MCCANN. Take you for constitutionals.
GOLDBERG. Give you hot tips.
MCCANN. We'll provide the skipping rope.
GOLDBERG. The vest and pants.
MCCANN. The ointment.
GOLDBERG. The hot poultice.
MCCANN. The fingerstall.
GOLDBERG. The abdomen belt.
MCCANN. The ear plugs.
GOLDBERG. The baby powder.
MCCANN. The back scratcher.
GOLDBERG. The spare tyre.
MCCANN. The stomach pump.
GOLDBERG. The oxygen tent.
MCCANN. The prayer wheel.
GOLDBERG. The plaster of Paris.
MCCANN. The crash helmet.
GOLDBERG. The crutches.
MCCANN. A day and night service.
GOLDBERG. All on the house.
MCCANN. That's it.
GOLDBERG. We'll make a man of you.
MCCANN. And a woman.
GOLDBERG. You'll be re-orientated.
MCCANN. You'll be rich.
GOLDBERG. You'll be adjusted.
MCCANN. You'll be our pride and joy.
GOLDBERG. You'll be a mensch.
MCCANN. You'll be a success.
GOLDBERG. You'll be integrated.
MCCANN. You'll give orders.
GOLDBERG. You'll make decisions.
MCCANN. You'll be a magnate.
GOLDBERG. A statesman.
MCCANN. You'll own yachts.
GOLDBERG. Animals.
MCCANN. Animals.
GOLDBERG looks at MCCANN.
GOLDBERG. I said animals. (He turns back to STANLEY.) You'll be able to make or break, Stan. By my life. (Silence.
STANLEY is still.) Well? What do you say?
STANLEY's head lifts very slowly and turns in GOLD-BERG's direction.
GOLDBERG. What do you think? Eh, boy?
STANLEY begins to clench and unclench his eyes.
MCCANN. What's your opinion, sir? Of this prospect, sir?
GOLDBERG. Prospect. Sure. Sure it's a prospect.
STANLEY's hands clutching his glasses begin to tremble.
What's your opinion of such a prospect? Eh, Stanley?
STANLEY concentrates, his mouth opens, he attempts to speak, fails and emits sounds from his throat.
STANLEY. Uh-gug ... uh-gug ... eeehhh-gag... (On the breath.) Caahh... caahh... •
They watch him. He draws a long breath which shudders down his body. He concentrates.
GOLDBERG. Well, Stanny boy, what do you say, eh?
They watch. He concentrates. His head lowers, his chin draws into his chest, he crouches.
STANLEY. Ug-gughh... uh-gughhh....
MCCANN. What's your opinion, sir?
STANLEY. Caaahhh... caaahhh....
MCCANN. Mr Webber! What's your opinion?
GOLDBERG. What do you say, Stan? What do you think of the prospect?
MCCANN. What's your opinion of the prospect?
STANLEY's body shudders, relaxes, his head drops, he becomes still again, stooped. PBTEY enters from door, down-stage, left.
GOLDBERG. Still the same old Stan. Come with us. Come on, boy.
MCCANN. Come along with us.
PETEY. Where are you taking him?
They turn. Silence.
GOLDBERG. We're taking him to Monty.
PETEY. He can stay here.
GOLDBERG. Don't be silly.
PETEY. We can look after him here.
GOLDBERG. Why do you want to look after him?
PETEY. He's my guest.
GOLDBERG. He needs special treatment.
PETEY. We'll find someone.
GOLDBERG. No. Monty's the best there is. Bring him, McCann.
They help STANLEY out of the chair. They all three move towards the door, left.
PETEY. Leave him alone!
They stop. GOLDBERG studies him.
GOLDBERG (insidiously). Why don't you come with us, Mr Boles?
MCCANN. Yes, why don't you come with us?
GOLDBERG. Come with us to Monty. There's plenty of room in the car.
PETEY makes no move. They pass him and reach the door.
MCCANN opens the door and picks up the suitcases.
PETEY (broken). Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!
They exit.
Silence. PETEY stands. The front door slams. Sound of a car starting. Sound of a car going away. Silence. PETEY slowly goes to the table. He sits on a chair, left. He picks up the paper and opens it. The strips fall to the floor. He looks down at them. MEG comes past the window and enters by the back door. PETEY studies the front page of the paper.
MEG (coming downstage). The car's gone.
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. Have they gone?
PETEY. Yes.
MEG. Won't they be in for lunch?
PETEY. No.
MEG. Oh, what a shame. (She puts her bag on the table.) It's hot out. (She hangs her coat on a hook.) What are you doing?
PETEY. Reading.
MEG. Is it good?
PETEY. All right.
She sits by the table.
MEG. Where's Stan?
Pause.
Is Stan down yet, Petey?
PETEY. No. • he's....
MEG. Is he still in bed?
PETEY. Yes, he's ... still asleep.
MEG. Still? He'll be late for his breakfast.
PETEY. Let him... sleep.
Pause.
MEG. Wasn't it a lovely party last night?
PETEY. I wasn't there.
MEG. Weren't you?
PETEY. I came in afterwards.
MEG. Oh.
Pause.
It was a lovely party. I haven't laughed so much for years.
We had dancing and singing. And games. You should have been there.
PETEY. It was good, eh?
Pause.
MEG. I was the belle of the ball.
PETEY. Were you?
MEG. Oh yes. They all said I was.
PETEY. I bet you were, too.
MEG. Oh, it's true. I was.
Pause.
I know I was.
Curtain


MICK is alone in the room, sitting on the bed. He wears a leather jacket.
Silence.
He slowly looks about the room looking at each object in turn.
He looks up at the ceiling, and stares at the bucket. Ceasing, he sits quite still, expressionless, looking out front.
Silence for thirty seconds.
A door bangs. Muffled voices are heard.
MICK turns his head. He stands, moves silently to the door, goes out, and closes the door quietly.
Silence.
Voices are heard again. They draw nearer, and stop. The door opens. ASTON and DAVIES enter, ASTON first, DAVIES following, shambling, breathing heavily.
ASTON wears an old tweed overcoat, and under it a thin shabby dark-blue pinstripe suit, single-breasted, with a pullover and faded shirt and tie. DAVIES wears a worn brown overcoat, shapeless trousers, a waistcoat, vest, no shirt, and sandals. ASTON puts the key in his pocket and closes the door. DAVIES looks about the room.
ASTON. Sit down.
DAVIES. Thanks. (Looking about.) Uuh... 
ASTON. Just a minute.
ASTON looks around for a chair, sees one lying on its side by the rolled carpet at the fireplace, and starts to get it out.
DAVIES. Sit down? Huh ... I haven't had a good sit down... I haven't had a proper sit down ... well, I couldn't tell you…
ASTON (placing the chair). Here you are.
DAVIES. Ten minutes off for a tea-break in the middle of the night in that place and I couldn't find a seat, not one. All them Greeks had it, Poles, Greeks, Blacks, the lot of them, all them aliens had it. And they had me working there... they had me working....
ASTON sits on the bed, takes out a tobacco tin and papers, and begins to roll himself a cigarette. DAVIES watches him.
All them Blacks had it, Blacks, Greeks, Poles, the lot of them, that's what, doing me out of a seat, treating me like dirt.
When he come at me tonight I told him.
Pause.
ASTON. Take a seat.
DAVIES. Yes, but what I got to do first, you see, what I got to do, I got to loosen myself up, you see what I mean? I could have got done in down there.
DAVIES exclaims loudly, punches downward with closed fist, turns his back to ASTON and stares at the wall.
Pause. ASTON lights a cigarette.
ASTON. You want to roll yourself one of these?
DAVIES (turning). What? No, no, I never smoke a cigarette.
(Pause. He comes forward.) I'll tell you what, though. I'll have a bit of that tobacco there for my pipe, if you like.
ASTON (handing him the tin). Yes. Go on. Take some out of that.
DAVIES. That's kind of you, mister. Just enough to fill my pipe, that's all. (He takes a pipe from his pocket and fills it.) I had a tin, only ... only a while ago. But it was knocked off. It was knocked off on the Great West Road. (He holds out the tin). Where shall I put it?
ASTON. I'll take it.
DAVIES (handing the tin). When he come at me tonight I told him. Didn't I? You heard me tell him, didn't you?
ASTON. I saw him have a go at you.
DAVIES. Go at me? You wouldn't grumble. The filthy skate, an old man like me, I've had dinner with the best.
Pause.
ASTON. Yes, I saw him have a go at you.
DAVIES. All them toe-rags, mate, got the manners of pigs. I might have been on the road a few years but you can take it from me I'm clean. I keep myself up. That's why I left my wife. Fortnight after I married her, no, not so much as that, no more than a week, I took the lid off a saucepan, you know what was in it? A pile of her underclothing, unwashed.
The pan for vegetables, it was. The vegetable pan. That's when I left her and I haven't seen her since.
DAVIES turns, shambles across the room, comes face to face with a statue of Buddha standing on the gas stove, looks at it and turns.
I've eaten my dinner off the best of plates. But I'm not young any more. I remember the days I was as handy as any of them. They didn't take any liberties with me. But I haven't been so well lately. I've had a few attacks.
Pause.
(Coming closer.) Did you see what happened with that one?
ASTON. I only got the end of it.
DAVIES. Comes up to me, parks a bucket of rubbish at me tells me to take it out the back. It's not my job to take out the bucket! They got a boy there for taking out the bucket. I wasn't engaged to take out buckets. My job's cleaning the floor, clearing up the tables, doing a bit of washing-up, nothing to do with taking out buckets!
ASTON. Uh.
He crosses down right, to get the electric roaster.
DAVIES (following). Yes, well say I had! Even if I had! Even if I was supposed to take out the bucket, who was this git to come up and give me orders? We got the same standing.
He's not my boss. He's nothing superior to me.
ASTON. What was he, a Greek?
DAVIES. Not him, he was a Scotch. He was a Scotchman.
(ASTON goes back to his bed with the toaster and starts to unscrew the plug. DAVIES follows him). You got an eye of him, did you?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. I told him what to do with his bucket. Didn't I? You heard. Look here, I said, I'm an old man, I said, where I was brought up we had some idea how to talk to old people with the proper respect, we was brought up with the right ideas, if I had a few years off me I'd ... I'd break you in half.
That was after the guvnor give me the bullet. Making too much commotion, he says. Commotion, me! Look here, I said to him, I got my rights. I told him that. I might have been on the road but nobody's got more rights than I have.
Let's have a bit of fair play, I said. Anyway, he give me the bullet. (He sits in the chair). That's the sort of place.
Pause.
If you hadn't come out and stopped that Scotch git I'd be inside the hospital now. I'd have cracked my head on that pavement if he'd have landed. I'll get him. One night I'll get him. When I find myself around that direction.
ASTON crosses to the plug box to get another plug.
I wouldn't mind so much but I left all my belongings in that place, in the back room there. All of them, the lot there was, you see, in this bag. Every lousy blasted bit of all my bleeding belongings I left down there now. In the rush of it. I bet he's having a poke around in it now this very moment.
ASTON. I'll pop down sometime and pick them up for you.
ASTON goes back to his bed and starts to fix the plug on the toaster.
DAVIES. Anyway, I'm obliged to you, letting me ... letting me have a bit of a rest, like ... for a few minutes. (He looks about.) This your room?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. You got a good bit of stuff here.
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Must be worth a few bob, this…put it all to-gether.
Pause.
There's enough of it.
ASTON. There's a good bit of it, all right.
DAVIES. You sleep here, do you?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. What, in that?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Yes, well, you'd be well out of the draught there.
ASTON. You don't get much wind.
DAVIES. You'd be well out of it. It's different when you're kipping out.
ASTON. Would be.
DAVIES. Nothing but wind then.
Pause.
ASTON. Yes, when the wind gets up it...
Pause.
DAVIES. Yes....
ASTON. Mmnn... Pause.
DAVIES. Gets very draughty.
ASTON. Ah.
DAVIES. I'm very sensitive to it.
ASTON. Are you?
DAVIES. Always have been.
Pause.
You got any more rooms then, have you?
ASTON. Where?
DAVIES. I mean, along the landing here... up the landing there.
ASTON. They're out of commission.
DAVIES. Get away.
ASTON. They need a lot of doing to.
Slight pause.
DAVIES. What about downstairs?
ASTON. That's closed up. Needs seeing to…The floors…
Pause.
DAVIES. I was lucky you come into that caff. I might have been done by that Scotch git. I been left for dead more than
олсе.
Pause.
I noticed that there was someone was living in the house next door.
ASTON. What?
DAVIES. (gesturing). I noticed… 
ASTON. Yes. There's people living all along the road.
DAVIES. Yes, I noticed the curtains pulled down there next door as we came along.
ASTON. They're neighbours.
Pause.
DAVIES. This your house then, is it?
Pause.
ASTON. I'm in charge.
DAVIES. You the landlord, are you?
He puts a pipe in his mouth and puffs without lighting it.
Yes, I noticed them heavy curtains pulled across next door as we came along. I noticed them heavy big curtains right across the window down there. I thought there must be someone living there.
ASTON. Family of Indians live there.
DAVIES. Blacks?
ASTON. I don't see much of them.
DAVIES. Blacks, eh? (DAVIES stands and moves about.) Well you've got some knick-knacks here all right, I'll say that. I don't like a bare room. (ASTON joins DAVIES upstage centre).
I'll tell you what, mate, you haven't got a spare pair of shoes?
ASTON. Shoes?
ASTON moves downstage right.
DAVIES. Them bastards at the monastery let me down again.
ASTON. (going to his bed.) Where?
DAVIES. Down in Luton. Monastery down at Luton…I got a mate at Shepherd's Bush, you see. ...
ASTON (looking under his bed). I might have a pair.
DAVIES. I got this mate at Shepherd's Bush. In the convenience. Well, he was in the convenience. Run about the best convenience they had. (He watches ASTON.) Run about the best one. Always slipped me a bit of soap, any time I went in there. Very good soap. They have to have the best soap. I was never without a piece of soap, whenever I happened to be knocking about the Shepherd's Bush area.
ASTON (emerging from under the bed with shoes). Pair of brown.
DAVIES. He's gone now. Went. He was the one who put me on to this monastery. Just the other side of Luton. He'd heard they give away shoes.
ASTON. You've got to have a good pair of shoes.
DAVIES. Shoes? It's life and death to me. I had to go all the way to Luton in these.
ASTON. What happened when you got there, then?
Pause.
DAVIES. I used to know a bootmaker in Acton. He was a good mate to me.
Pause.
You know what that bastard monk said to me?
Pause.
How many more Blacks you got around here then?
ASTON. What?
DAVIES. You got any more Blacks around here?
ASTON (holding out the shoes). See if these are any good.
DAVIES. You know what that bastard monk said to me? (He looks over to the shoes.) I think those'd be a bit small.
ASTON. Would they?
DAVIES. No, don't look the right size.
ASTON. Not bad trim.
DAVIES. Can't wear shoes that don't fit. Nothing worse. I said to this monk, here, I said, look here, mister, he opened the door, big door, he opened it, look here, mister, I said, I come all the way down here, look, I said, I showed him these, I said, you haven't got a pair of shoes, have you, a pair of shoes, I said, enough to keep me on my way. Look at these, they're nearly out, I said, they're no good to me. I heard you got a stock of shoes here. Piss off, he said to me. Now look here, I said, I'm an old man, you can't talk to me like that, I don't care who you are. If you don't piss off, he says, I'll kick you all the way to the gate. Now look here, I said, now wait a minute, all I'm asking for is a pair of shoes, you don't want to start taking liberties with me, it's taken me three days to get here, I said to him, three days without a bite, I'm worth a bite to eat, en I? Get out round the corner to the kitchen, he says, get out round the corner, and when you've had your meal, piss off out of it. I went round to this kitchen, see? Meal they give me! A bird, I tell you, a little bird, a little tiny bird, he could have ate it in under two minutes. Right, they said to me, you've bad your meal, get off out of it. Meal? I said, what do you think I am, a dog?
Nothing better than a dog. What do you think I am, a wild animal? What about them shoes I come all the way here to get I heard you was giving away? I've a good mind to report you to your mother superior. One of them, an Irish hooligan, come at me. I cleared out. I took a short cut to Watford and picked up a pair there. Got onto the North Circular, just past Hendon, the sole come off, right where I was walking.
Lucky I had my old ones wrapped up, still carrying them, otherwise I'd have been finished, man. So I've had to stay with these, you see, they're gone, they're no good, all the good's gone out of them.
ASTON. Try these.
DAVIES takes the shoes, takes off his sandals and tries them on.
DAVIES. Not a bad pair of shoes. (He trudges round the room.)
They're strong, all right. Yes. Not a bad shape of shoe.
This leather's hardy, en't? Very hardy. Some bloke tried to fog me some suede the other day. I wouldn't wear them.
Can't beat leather, for wear. Suede goes off, it creases, it stains for life in five minutes. You can't beat leather. Yes.
Good shoe this.
ASTON. Good.
DAVIES waggles his jeet.
DAVIES. Don't fit though.
ASTON. Ob?
DAVIES. No. I got a very broad foot.
ASTON. Mmnn.
DAVIES. These are too pointed, you see.
ASTON. Ah.
DAVIES. They'd cripple me in a week. I mean these ones I got on, they're no good but at least they're comfortable. No much cop, but I mean they don't hurt. (He takes them off and gives them back). Thanks anyway, mister.
ASTON. I'll see what I can look out for you.
DAVIES. Good luck. I can't go on like this. Can't get from one place to another. And I'll have to be moving about, you see, try to get fixed up.
ASTON. Where you going to go?
DAVIES. Oh, I got one or two things in mind. I'm waiting for the weather to break.
Pause.
ASTON (attending to the toaster). Would… would you like to sleep here?
DAVIES. Here?
ASTON. You can sleep here if you like.
DAVIES. Here? Oh, I don't know about that.
Pause.
How long for?
ASTON. Till you…get yourself fixed up.
DAVIES (sitting). Ay well, that…
ASTON. Get yourself sorted out…
DAVIES. Oh, I'll be fixed up… pretty soon now…
Pause.
Where would I sleep?
ASTON. Here. The other rooms would…would be no good to you.
DAVIES (rising, looking about). Here? Where?
ASTON (rising, pointing upstage right). There's a bed behind all that.
DAVIES. Oh, I see. Well, that's handy. Well, that's…I tell you what, I might do that… just till I get myself sorted out. You got enough furniture here.
ASTON. I picked it up. Just keeping it here for the time being.
Thought it might come in handy.
DAVIES. This gas stove work, do it?
ASTON. No.
DAVIES. What do you do for a cup of tea?
ASTON. Nothing.
DAVIES. That's a bit rough. (DAVIES observes the planks.) You building something?
ASTON. I might build a shed out the back.
DAVIES. Carpenter, eh? (He turns to the lawn-mower.) Got a lawn.
ASTON. Have a look.
ASTON lifts the sack at the window. They look out.
DAVIES. Looks a bit thick.
ASTON. Overgrown.
DAVIES. What's that, a pond?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. What you got, fish?
ASTON. No. There isn't anything in there.
Pause.
DAVIES. Where you going to put your shed?
ASTON (turning). I'll have to clear the garden first.
DAVIES. You'd need a tractor, man.
ASTON. I'll get it done.
DAVIES. Carpentry, eh?
ASTON (standing still). I like…working with my hands.
DAVIES picks up the statue of Buddha.
DAVIES. What's this?
ASTON (taking and studying it). That's a Buddha.
DAVIES. Get on.
ASTON. Yes. I quite like it. Picked it up in a…iin a shop.
Looked quite nice to me. Don't know why. What do you think of these Buddhas?
DAVIES. Oh, they're…they're all right, en't they?
ASTON. Yes, I was pleased when I got hold of this one. I, very well made.
DAVIES turns and peers under the sink.
DAVIES. This the bed here, is it?
ASTON (moving to the bed). We'll get rid of all that. The ladder'll fit under the bed. (They put the ladder under the bed.)
DAVIES (indicating the sink). What about this?
ASTON. I think that'll fit in under here as well.
DAVIES. I'll give you a hand. (They lift it.) It's a ton weight, en't?
ASTON. Under here.
DAVIES. This in use at all, then?
ASTON. No. I'll be getting rid of it. Here.
They place the sink under the bed.
There's a lavatory down the landing. It's got a sink in there.
We can put this stuff over there.
They begin to move the coal bucket, shopping trolley, lawnmower and sideboard drawers to the right wall.
DAVIES (stopping). You don't share it, do you?
ASTON. What?
DAVIES. I mean you don't share the toilet with them Blacks, do you?
ASTON. They live next door.
DAVIES. They don't come in?
ASTON puts a drawer against the wall.
Because, you know ... I mean ... fair's fair....
ASTON goes to the bed, blows dust and shakes a blanker.
ASTON. You see a blue case?
DAVIES. Blue case? Down here. Look. By the carpet.
ASTON goes to the case, opens it, takes out a sheer and pillow and puts them on the bed.
That's a nice sheet.
ASTON. The blanket'll be a bit dusty.
DAVIES. Don't you worry about that.
ASTON stands upright, takes out his tobacco and begins to roll a cigarette. He goes to his bed and sits.
ASTON. How are you off for money?
DAVIES. Oh well... now, mister, if you want the truth …
I'm a bit short.
ASTON takes some coins from his pocket, sorts them, and holds out five shillings.
ASTON. Here's a few bob.
DAVIES (taking the coins). Thank you, thank you, good luck. I just happen to find myself a bit short. You see, I got nothing for all that week's work I did last week. That's the position, that's what it is.
Pause.
ASTON. I went into a pub the other day. Ordered a Guinness.
They gave it to me in a thick mug. I sat down but I couldn't drink it. I can't drink Guinness from a thick mug. I only like it out of a thin glass. I had a few sips but I couldn't finish it.
ASTON picks up a screwdriver and plug from the bed and begins to poke the plug.
DAVIES (with great feeling). If only the weather would break!
Then I'd be able to get down to Sidcup!
ASTON. Sidcup?
DAVIES. The weather's so blasted bloody awful, how can I get down to Sidcup in these shoes?
ASTON. Why do you want to get down to Sidcup?
DAVIES. I got my papers there!
Pause.
ASTON. Your what?
DAVIES. I got my papers there!
Pause.
ASTON. What are they doing at Sidcup?
DAVIES. A man I know has got them. I left them with him.
You see? They prove who I am! I can't move without them papers. They tell you who 1 am. You see! I'm stuck without ASTON. Why's that?
DAVIES. You see, what it is, you see, I changed my name!
Years ago. I been going around under an assumed name!
That's not my real name.
ASTON. What name you been going under?
DAVIES. Jenkins. Bernard Jenkins. That's my name. That's the name I'm known, anyway. But it's no good me going on with that name. I got no rights. I got an insurance card here.
(He takes a card from his pocket.) Under the name of Jenkins.
See? Bernard Jenkins. Look. It's got four stamps on it. Four of them. But I can't go along with these. That's not my real name, they'd find out, they'd have me in the nick. Four stamps. I haven't paid out pennies. I've paid out pounds.
I've paid out pounds, not pennies. There's been other stamps, plenty, but they haven't put them on, the nigs, I never had enough time to go into it.
ASTON. They should have stamped your card.
DAVIES. It would have done no good! I'd have got nothing anyway. That's not my real name. If I take that card along I go in the nick.
ASTON. What's your real name, then?
DAVIES. Davies. Mac Davies. That was before I changed my name.
Pause.
ASTON. It looks as though you want to sort all that out.
DAvIeS. If only I could get down to Sidcup! I've been waiting for the weather to break. He's got my papers, this man I left them with, it's got it all down there, I could prove every-thing.
ASTON. How long's he had them?
DAVIES. What?
ASTON. How long's he had them?
DAVIES. Ob, must be. • . it was in the war .. . must be ...about near on fifteen year ago.
He suddenly becomes aware of the bucket and looks up.
ASTON. Any time you want to . . • get into bed, just get in.
Don't worry about me.
DAVIES (taking off his overcoat). Eh, well, I think I will. I'm a bit ... a bit done in. (He steps out of his trousers, and holds them out). Shall I put these on here?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES puts the coat and trousers on the clothes horse.
DAVIES. I see you got a bucket up here.
ASTON. Leak.
DAVIES looks up.
DAVIES. Well, I'll try your bed then. You getting in?
ASTON. I'm mending this plug.
DAVIES looks at him and then at the gas stove.
DAVIES. You …you can't move this, eh?
ASTON. Bit heavy.
DAVIES. Yes.
DAVIES gets into bed. He tests his weight and length.
Not bad. Not bad. A fair bed. I think I'll sleep in this.
ASTON. I'll have to fix a proper shade on that bulb. The light's a bit glaring.
DAVIES. Don't you worry about that, mister, don't you worry about that. (He turns and puts the cover up).
ASTON sits, poking his plug.
The LIGHTS FADE OUT. Darkness.
LIGHTS UP. Morning.
ASTON is fastening his trousers, standing by the bed. He straightens his bed. He turns, goes to the centre of the room and looks at DAVIES. He turns, puts his jacket on, turns, goes towards DAVIES and looks down on him.
He coughs. DAVIES sits up abruptly.
DAVIES. What? What's this? What's this?
ASTON. It's all right.
DAVIES (staring). What's this?
ASTON. It's all right.
DAVIES looks about.
DAVIES. Oh, yes.
ASTON goes to his bed, picks up the plug and shakes it.
ASTON. Sleep well?
DAVIES. Yes. Dead out. Must have been dead out.
ASTON goes downstage right, collects the toaster and examines it.
ASTON. You ... er…
DAVIES. Eh?
ASTON. Were you dreaming or something?
DAVIES. Dreaming?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. I don't dream. I've never dreamed.
ASTON. No, nor have I.
DAVIES. Nor me.
Pause.
Why you ask me that, then?
ASTON. You were making noises.
DAVIES. Who was?
ASTON. You were.
DAVIES gets out of bed. He wears long underpants.
DAVIES. Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute, what do you mean? What kind of noises?
ASTON. You were making groans. You were jabbering.
DAVIES. Jabbering? Me?
ASTON, Yes.
DAVIES. I don't jabber, man. Nobody ever told me that before.
Pause.
What would I be jabbering about?
ASTON. I don't know.
DAVIES. I mean, where's the sense in it?
Pause.
Nobody ever told me that before.
Pause.
You got hold of the wrong bloke, mate.
ASTON (crossing to the bed with the toaster). No. You woke me up. I thought you might have been dreaming.
DAVIES. I wasn't dreaming. I never had a dream in my life.
Pause.
ASTON. Maybe it was the bed.
DAVIES. Nothing wrong with this bed.
ASTON. Might be a bit unfamiliar.
DAVIES. There's nothing unfamiliar about me with beds. I slept in beds. I don't make noises just because I sleep in a bed. I slept in plenty of beds.
Pause.
I tell you what, maybe it were them Blacks.
ASTON. What?
DAVIES. Them noises.
ASTON. What Blacks?
DAVIES. Them you got. Next door. Maybe it were them Blacks making noises, coming up through the walls.
ASTON. Hmmnn.
DAVIES. That's my opinion.
ASTON puts down the plug and moves to the door.
Where you going, you going out?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES (seizing the sandals). Wait a minute then, just a minute.
ASTON. What you doing?
DAVIES (putting on the sandals). I better come with you.
ASTON. Why?
DAVIES. I mean, I better come out with you, anyway.
ASTON. Why?
DAVIES. Well... don't you want me to go out?
ASTON. What for?
DAVIES. I mean ... when you're out. Don't you want me to get out... when you're out?
ASTON. You don't have to go out.
DAVIES. You mean ... I can stay here?
ASTON. Do what you like. You don't have to come out just because I go out.
DAVIES. You don't mind me staying here?
ASTON. I've got a couple of keys. (He goes to a box by his bed and finds them.) This door and the front door. (He hands them to DAVIES.)
DAVIES. Thanks very much, the best of luck.
Pause. ASTON stands.
ASTON. I think I'l take a stroll down the road. A little ..• kind of a shop. Man there'd got a jig saw the other day. I quite liked the look of it.
DAVIES. A jig saw, mate?
ASTON. Yes. Could be very useful.
DAVIES. Yes.
Slight pause.
What's that then, exactly, then?
ASTON walks up to the window and looks out.
ASTON. A jig saw? Well, it comes from the same family as the fret saw. But it's an appliance, you see. You have to fix it on to a portable drill.
DAVIES. Ah, that's right. They're very handy.
ASTON. They are, yes.
Pause.
You know, I was sitting in a café the other day. I happened to be sitting at the same table as this woman. Well, we started to ... we started to pick up a bit of a conversation.
I don't know... about her holiday, it was, where she'd been. She'd been down to the south coast. I can't remember where though. Anyway, we were just sitting there, having this bit of a conversation. •. then suddenly she put her hand over to mine... and she said, how would you like me to have a look at your body?
DAVIES. Get out of it.
Pause.
ASTON. Yes. To come out with it just like that, in the middle of this conversation. Struck me as a bit odd.
DAVIES. They've said the same thing to me.
ASTON. Have they?
DAVIES. Women? There's many a time they've come up to me and asked me more or less the same question.
Pause.
ASTON. What did you say your name was?
DAVIES. Bernard Jenkins is my assumed one.
ASTON. No, your other one?
DAVIES. Davies. Mac Davies.
ASTON. Welsh, are you?
DAVIES. Eh?
ASTON. You Welsh?
Pause.
DAVIES. Well, I been around, you know ... what I mean…I been about…
ASTON. Where were you born then?
DAVIES. (darkly). What do you mean?
ASTON. Where were you born?
DAVIES. I was…uh…oh, it's a bit hard, like, to set your mind back …see what I mean …going back…a good way…lose a bit of track, like … you…know….
ASTON (going to belor the fireplace). See this plug? Switch it on here, if you like. This little fire.
DAVIES. Right, mister.
ASTON. Just plug in here.
DAVIES. Right, mister.
ASTON goes towards the door.
(Anxiously). What do I do?
ASTON. Just switch it on, that's all. The fire'll come on.
DAVIES. I tell you what. I won't bother about it.
ASTON. No trouble.
DAVIES. No, I don't go in for them things much.
ASTON. Should work. (Turning). Right.
DAVIES. Eh, I was going to ask you, mister, what about this stove? I mean, do you think it's going to be letting out any…what do you think?
ASTON. It's not connected.
DAVIES. You see, the trouble is, it's right on top of my bed, you see? What I got to watch is nudging ... one of them gas taps with my elbow when I get up, you get my meaning?
He goes round to the other side of stove and examines it.
ASTON. There's nothing to worry about.
DAVIES. Now look here, don't you worry about it. All I'll do, I'll keep an eye on these taps every now and again, like, you see. See they're switched off. You leave it to me.
ASTON. I don't think ....
DAVIES (coming round). Eh, mister, just one thing ... eh….you couldn't slip me a couple of bob, for a cup of tea,
just, you know?
ASTON. I gave you a few bob last night.
DAVIES. Eh, so you did. So you did. I forgot. Went clean out of my mind. That's right. Thank you, mister. Listen. You're sure now, you're sure you don't mind me staying here? I mean, I'm not the sort of man who wants to take any liberties.
ASTON. No, that's all right.
DAVIES. I might get down to Wembley later on in the day.
ASTON. Uh-uh.
DAVIES. There's a caff down there, you see, might be able to get fixed up there. I was there, see? I know they were a bit short-handed. They might be in the need of a bit of staff.
ASTON. When was that?
DAVIES. Eh? Oh, well, that was …near on… that'll be ... that'll be a little while ago now. But of course what it is, they can't find the right kind of people in these places.
What they want to do, they're trying to do away with these foreigners, you see, in catering. They want an Englishman to pour their tea, that's what they want, that's what they're crying out for. It's only common sense, en't? Oh, I got all that under way ... that's ... uh... that's ... what I'll be doing.
Pause.
If only I could get down there.
ASTON. Mmnn. (ASTON moves to the door.) Well, I'll be seeing you then.
DAVIES. Yes. Right.
ASTON goes out and closes the door.
DAVIES stands still. He waits a few seconds, then goes to the door, opens it, looks out, closes it, stands with his back to it, turns swiftly, opens it, looks out, comes back, closes the door, finds the keys in his pocket, tries one, tries the other, locks the door. He looks about the room. He then goes quickly to ASTON's bed, bends, brings out the pair of shoes and examines them.
Not a bad pair of shoes. Bit pointed.
He puts them back under the bed. He examines the area by ASTON's bed, picks up a vase and looks into it, then picks up a box and shakes it.
Screws!
He sees paint buckets at the top of the bed, goes to them, and examines them.
Paint. What's he going to paint?
He purs the bucket down, comes to the centre of the room, looks up at bucket, and grimaces.
I'll have to find out about that. (He crosses right, and picks up a blow-lamp.) He's got some stuff in here. (He picks up the Buddha and looks at it.) Full of stuff. Look at all this. (His eye falls on the piles of papers.) What's he got all those papers for? Damn pile of papers.
He goes to a pile and touches it. The pile wobbles. He steadies it.
Hold it, hold it!
He holds the pile and pushes the papers back into place.
The door opens.
MICk comes in, puts the key in his pocket, and closes the door silently. He stands at the door and watches DAVIES.
What's he got all these papers for? (DAVIES climbs over the rolled carpet to the blue case.) Had a sheet and pillow ready in here. (He opens the case.) Nothing. (He shuts the case.) Still, I had a sleep though. I don't make no noises. (He looks at the window.) What's this?
He picks up another case and tries to open it. MICK moves up-stage, silently.
Locked. (He puts it down and moves downstage.) Must be something in it. He picks up a sideboard drawer, rummages in the contents, then puts it down.)
MICK slides across the room.
DAVIES half turns, MICK seizes his arm and forces it up his back. DAVIES screams.
Uuuuuuuhhh! Uuuuuuuhhh! What! What! What!
Juuuuuuhhh!
MICK swiftly forces him to the floor, with DAVIES struggling, grimacing, whimpering and staring.
MICk holds his arm, puts his other hand to his lips, then puts his hand to DAVIES' lips. DAVIES quietens. MICK lets him go. DAVIES writhes. MICK holds out a warning finger. He then squats down to regard DAVIES. He regards him, then stands looking down on him. DAVIES massages his arm, watching MICK. MICK turns slowly to look at the room. He goes to DAVIES' bed and uncovers it. He turns, goes to the clothes horse and picks up DAVIES' trousers. DAVIES starts to rise. MICK presses him down with his foot and stands over him. Finally he removes his foot. He examines the trousers and throws them back. DAVIES remains on the floor, crouched. MICR slowly goes to the chair, sits, and watches
DAVIES, expressionless.
Silence.
MICK. What's the game?
Curtain.


A few seconds later.
MICK is seated, DAVIES on the floor, half seated, crouched.
Silence.
MICK. Well?
DAVIES. Nothing, nothing. Nothing.
A drip sounds in the bucket overhead. They look up. MICR looks back to DAVIES.
MICK. What's your name?
DAVIES. I don't know you. I don't know who you are.
Pause.
MICK. Eh?
DAVIES. Jenkins.
MICK. Jenkins?
DAVIES. Yes.
MICK. Jen ... kins.
Pause.
You sleep here last night?
DAVIES. Yes.
MICK. Sleep well?
DAVIES. Yes.
MICK. I'm awfully glad. It's awfully nice to meet you.
Pause.
What did you say your name was?
DAVIES. Jenkins.
MICK. I beg your pardon?
DAVIES. Jenkins!
MICK. Jen... kins.
A drip sounds in the bucket. DAVIES looks up.
You remind me of my uncle's brother. He was always on the move, that man. Never without his passport. Had an eye for the girls. Very much your build. Bit of an athlete. Long-jump specialist. He had a habit of demonstrating different run-ups in the drawing-room round about Christmas time.
Had a penchant for nuts. That's what it was. Nothing else but a penchant. Couldn't eat enough of them. Peanuts, walnuts, brazil nuts, monkey nuts, wouldn't touch a piece of fruit cake. Had a marvellous stop-watch. Picked it up in Hong Kong. The day after they chucked him out of the Salvation Army. Used to go in number four for Beckenham Reserves. That was before he got his Gold Medal. Had a funny habit of carrying his fiddle on his back. Like a papoose.
I think there was a bit of the Red Indian in him. To be honest, I've never made out how he came to be my uncle's brother. I've often thought that maybe it was the other way round. I mean that my uncle was his brother and he was my uncle. But I never called him uncle. As a matter of fact I called him Sid. My mother called him Sid too. It was a funny business. Your spitting image he was. Married a Chinaman and went to Jamaica.
Pause.
I hope you slept well last night.
DAVIES. Listen! I don't know who you are!
MICK. What bed you sleep in?
DAVIES. Now look here
MICK. Eh?
DAVIES. That one.
MICK. Not the other one?
DAVIES. No.
MICR. Choosy.
Pause.
How do you like my room?
DAVIES. Your room?
MICK. Yes.
DAVIES. This ain't your room. I don't know who you are. I ain't never seen you before.
MIck. You know, believe it or not, you've got a funny kind of resemblance to a bloke I once knew in Shoreditch. Actually he lived in Aldgate. I was staying with a cousin in Camden Town. This chap, he used to have a pitch in Finsbury Park, just by the bus depot. When I got to know him I found out he was brought up in Putney. That didn't make any difference to me. I know quite a few people who were born in Putney. Even if they weren't born in Putney they were born in Fulham. The only trouble was, he wasn't born in Putney, he was only brought up in Putney. It turned out he was born in the Caledonian Road, just before you get to the Nag's Head. His old mum was still living at the Angel. All the buses passed right by the door. She could get a 38, 581, 30 or 38A, take her down the Essex Road to Dalston Junction in next to no time. Well, of course, if she got the 30 he'd take her up Upper Street way, round by High-bury Corner and down to St. Paul's Church, but she'd get to Dalston Junction just the same in the end. I used to leave my bike in her garden on my way to work. Yes, it was a curious affair. Dead spit of you he was. Bit bigger round the nose but there was nothing in it.
Pause.
Did you sleep here last night?
DAVIES. Yes.
MICR. Sleep well?
DAVIES. Yes!
MIcK. Did you have to get up in the night?
DAVIES. No!
Pause.
MICK. What's your name?
DAVIES (shifting, about to rise). Now look here!
MICK. What?
DAVIES. Jenkins!
MICk. Jen... kins.
DAVIES makes a sudden move to rise. A violent belloro from MICk sends him back.
(A shout.) Sleep here last night?
DAVIES. Yes..••
MICK (continuing at great pace). How'd you sleep?
DAVIES. I slept—
MICK. Sleep well?
DAVIES. Now look—
MICK. What bed?
DAVIES. That—
MICK. Not the other?
DAVIES. No!
MICK. Choosy.
Pause.
(Quietly.) Choosy.
Pause.
(Again amiable.) What sort of sleep did you have in that bed?
DAVIES (banging on floor). All right!
MICK. You weren't uncomfortable?
DAVIES (groaning). All right!
MICK stands, and moves to him.
MICK. You a foreigner?
DAVIES. No.
MICK. Born and bred in the British Isles?
DAVIES. I was!
MICK. What did they teach you?
Pause.
How did you like my bed?
Pause.
That's my bed. You want to mind you don't catch a draught.
DAVIES. From the bed?
MIck. No, now, up your arse.
DAVIES stares warily at MICK, who turns. DAVIES scrambles to the clothes horse and seizes his trousers. MICR turns swiftly and grabs them. DAVIES lunges for them.
MICk holds out a hand warningly.
You intending to settle down here?
DAVIES. Give me my trousers then.
MICK. You settling down for a long stay?
DAVIES. Give me my bloody trousers!
MICk. Why, where you going?
DAVIES. Give me and I'm going, I'm going to Sidcup!
MICK ficks the trousers in DAVIES' face several times.
DAVIES retreats.
Pause.
MICK. You know, you remind me of a bloke I bumped into once, just the other side of the Guildford by-pass—
DAVIES. I was brought here!
Pause.
MICK. Pardon?
DAVIES. I was brought here! I was brought here!
MICK. Brought here? Who brought you here?
DAVIES. Man who lives here ... he...
Pause.
MICK. Fibber.
DAVIES. I was brought here, last night... met him in a caff... I was working ... I got the bullet ... I was working there ... bloke saved me from a punch up, brought me here, brought me right here.
Pause.
MICK. I'm afraid you're a born fibber, en't you? You're speaking to the owner. This is my room. You're standing
in my house.
DAVIES. It's his ... he seen me all right... he…
MICK (pointing to DAVIES' bed). That's my bed.
DAVIES. What about that, then?
MIck. That's my mother's bed.
DAVIES. Well she wasn't in it last night!
MICK (moving to him). Now don't get perky, son, don't get perky. Keep your hands off my old mum.
DAVIES. I ain't ... I haven't. ...
MICK. Don't get out of your depth, friend, don't start taking liberties with my old mother, let's have a bit of respect.
DAVIES. I got respect, you won't find anyone with more respect.
MICK. Well, stop telling me all these fibs.
DAVIES. Now listen to me, I never seen you before, have I?
MICK. Never seen my mother before either, I suppose?
Pause.
I think I'm coming to the conclusion that you're an old rogue. You're nothing but an old scoundrel.
DAVIES. Now wait—
MICk. Listen, son. Listen, sonny. You stink.
DAVIES. You ain't got no right to
MICK. You're stinking the place out. You're an old robber, there's no getting away from it. You're an old skate. You don't belong in a nice place like this. You're an old bar-barian. Honest. You got no business wandering about in an unfurnished flat. I could charge seven quid a week for this if I wanted to. Get a taker tomorrow. Three hundred and fifty a year exclusive. No argument. I mean, if that sort of money's in your range don't be afraid to say so. Here you are. Furniture and fittings, I'll take four hundred or the nearest offer. Rateable value ninety quid for the annum.
You can reckon water, heating and lighting at close on fifty.
That'll cost you eight hundred and ninety if you're all that keen. Say the word and I'll have my solicitors draft you out a contract. Otherwise I've got the van outside, I can run you to the police station in five minutes, have you in for tres-passing, loitering with intent, daylight robbery, filching, thieving and stinking the place out. What do you say?
Unless you're really keen on a straightforward purchase. Of course, I'll get my brother to decorate it up for you first. I've got a brother who's a number one decorator. He'll decorate it up for you. If you want more space, there's four more rooms along the landing ready to go. Bathroom, living-room, bedroom and nursery. You can have this as your study. This brother I mentioned, he's just about to start on the other rooms. Yes, just about to start. So what do you say? Eight hundred odd for this room or three thousand down for the whole upper storey. On the other hand, if you prefer to approach it in the long-term way I know an insurance firm in West Ham'll be pleased to handle the deal for you. No strings attached, open and above board, untarnished record; twenty per cent interest, fifty per cent deposit; down payments, back payments, family allowances, bonus schemes, remission of term for good behaviour, six months lease, yearly examination of the relevant archives, tea laid on, disposal of shares, benefit extension, compensation on cessation, comprehensive indemnity against Riot, Civil Commotion, Labour Disturbances, Storm, Tempest, Thunderbolt, Larceny or Cattle all subject to a daily check and double check. Of course we'd need a signed declaration from your personal medical attendant as assurance that you possess the requisite fitness to carry the can, won't we?
Who do you bank with?
Pause.
Who do you bank with?
The door opens. ASTON comes in. MICR turns and drops the trousers. DAVIES picks them up and puts them on. ASTON, after a glance at the other two, goes to his bed, places a bag which he is carrying on it, sits down and resumes fixing the toaster. DAVIES retreats to his corner. MICK sits in the chair.
Silence.
A drip sounds in the bucket. They all look up.
Silence.
You still got that leak.
ASTON. Yes.
Pause.
It's coming from the roof.
MICR. From the roof, eh?
ASTON. Yes.
Pause.
I'll have to tar it over.
MICK. You're going to tar it over?
ASTON. Yes.
MICK. What?
ASTON. The cracks.
Pause.
MICK. You'll be tarring over the cracks on the roof.
ASTON. Yes.
Pause.
MICK. Think that'll do it?
ASTON. It'll do it, for the time being.
MICK. Uh.
Pause.
DAVIES (abruptly). What do you do—?
They both look at him.
What do you do ... when that bucket's full?
Pause.
ASTON. Empty it.
Pause.
MIck. I was telling my friend you were about to start decorating the other rooms.
ASTON. Yes.
Pause.
(To DAVIES.) I got your bag.
DAVIES. Oh. (Crossing to him and taking it). Oh thanks, mister, thanks. Give it to you, did they?
DAVIES crosses back with the bag.
MICK rises and snatches it.
MICK. What's this?
DAVIES. Give us it, that's my bag!
MICK (warding him off). I've seen this bag before.
DAVIES. That's my bag!
MICK (eluding him). This bag's very familiar.
DAVIES. What do you mean?
MICK. Where'd you get it?
ASTON (rising, to them). Scrub it.
DAVIES. That's mine.
MICK. Whose?
DAVIES. It's mine! Tell him it's mine!
MICK. This your bag?
DAVIES. Give me it!
ASTON. Give it to him.
MICK. What? Give him what?
DAVIES. That bloody bag!
MICR (slipping it behind the gas stove). What bag? (To DAVIES.)
What bag?
DAVIES (moving). Look here!
MICK (facing him). Where you going?
DAVIES. I'm going to get ... my old...
MICk. Watch your step, sonny! You're knocking at the door when no one's at home. Don't push it too hard. You come busting into a private house, laying your hands on anything you can lay your hands on. Don't overstep the mark, son.
ASTON picks up the bag.
DAVIES. You thieving bastard... you thieving skate ... let me get m
ASTON. Here you are. (ASTON offers the bag to DAVIES.)
MICK grabs it. ASTON takes it.
MICK grabs it. DAVIES reaches for it.
ASTON takes it. MICK reaches for it.
ASTON gives it to DAVIES. MICK grabs it.
Pause.
ASTON takes it. DAVIES takes it. MICK takes it. DAVIES reaches for it. ASTON takes it.
Pause.
ASTON gives it to MICK. MICK gives it to DAVIES.
DAVIES grasps it to him.
Pause.
MICK looks at ASTON. DAVIES moves away with the bag.
He drops it.
Pause.
They watch him. He picks it up. Goes to his bed, and sits.
ASTON goes to his bed, sits, and begins to roll a cigarette.
MICK stands still.
Pause.
A drip sounds in the bucket. They all look up.
Pause.
How did you get on at Wembley?
DAVIES. Well, I didn't get down there.
Pause.
No. I couldn't make it.
MICK goes to the door and exits.
ASTON. I had a bit of bad luck with that jig saw. When I got there it had gone.
Pause.
DAVIES. Who was that feller?
ASTON. He's my brother.
DAVIES. Is he? He's a bit of a joker, en'he?
ASTON. Uh.
DAVIES. Yes... he's a real joker.
ASTON. He's got a sense of humour.
DAVIES. Yes, I noticed.
Pause.
He's a real joker, that lad, you can see that.
Pause.
ASTON. Yes, he tends ... he tends to see the funny side of things.
DAVIES. Well, he's got a sense of humour, en' he?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Yes, you could tell that.
Pause.
I could tell the first time I saw him he had his own way of looking at things.
ASTON stands, goes to the sideboard drawer, right, picks up the statue of Buddha, and puts it on the gas stove.
ASTON. I'm supposed to be doing up the upper part of the house for him.
DAVIES. What ... you mean ... you mean it's his house?
ASTON. Yes. I'm supposed to be decorating this landing for him. Make a flat out of it.
DAVIES. What does he do, then?
ASTON. He's in the building trade. He's got his own van.
DAVIES. He don't live here, do he?
ASTON. Once I get that shed up outside ... I'll be able to give a bit more thought to the flat, you see. Perhaps I can knock up one or two things for it. (He walks to the window.) I can work with my hands, you see. That's one thing I can do. I never knew I could. But I can do all sorts of things now, with my hands. You know, manual things. When I get that shed up out there ... I'll have a workshop, you see.
I ... could do a bit of woodwork. Simple woodwork, to start. Working with ... good wood.
Pause.
Of course, there's a lot to be done to this place. What I think, though, I think I'll put in a partition... in one of the rooms along the landing. I think it'll take it. You know ... they've got these screens... you know ... Oriental.
They break up a room with them. Make it into two parts.
I could either do that or I could have a partition. I could knock them up, you see, if I had a workshop.
Pause.
Anyway, I think I've decided on the partition.
Pause.
DAVIES. Eh, look here, I been thinking. This ain't my bag.
ASTON. Oh. No.
DAVIES. No, this ain't my bag. My bag, it was another kind of bag altogether, you see. I know what they've done. What they done, they kept my bag, and they given you another one altogether.
ASTON. No ... what happened was, someone had gone oft with your bag.
DAVIES (rising). That's what I said!
ASTON. Anyway, I picked that bag up somewhere else. It's got a few ... pieces of clothes in it too. He let me have the whole lot cheap.
DAVIES (opening the bag). Any shoes?
DAVIES takes two check shirts, bright red and bright green, from the bag. He holds them up.
Check.
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Yes ... well, I know about these sort of shirts, you see. Shirts like these, they don't go far in the winter-time. I mean, that's one thing I know for a fact. No, what I need, is a kind of a shirt with stripes, a good solid shirt, with stripes going down. That's what I want. (He takes from the bag a deep-red velvet smoking-jacket.) What's this?
ASTON. It's a smoking-jacket.
DAVIES. A smoking-jacket? (He feels it.) This ain't a bad piece of cloth. I'll see how it fits.
He tries it on.
You ain't got a mirror here, have you?
ASTON. I don't think I have.
DAVIES. Well, it don't fit too bad. How do you think it looks?
ASTON. Looks all right.
DAVIES. Well, I won't say no to this, then.
ASTON picks up the plug and examines it.
No, I wouldn't say no to this.
Pause.
ASTON. You could be ... caretaker here, if you liked.
DAVIES. What?
ASTON. You could look after the place, if you liked... you know, the stairs and the landing, the front steps, keep an eye on it. Polish the bells.
DAVIES. Bells?
ASTON. I'll be fixing a few, down by the front door. Brass.
DAVIES. Caretaking, eh?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Well, I ... I never done caretaking before, you know ... I mean to say... I never ... what I mean to say is ... I never been a caretaker before.
Pause.
ASTON. How do you feel about being one, then?
DAVIES. Well, I reckon ... Well, I'd have to know ... you know...
ASTON. What sort of...
DAVIES. Yes, what sort of... you know ...
Pause.
ASTON. Well, I mean ...
DAVIES. I mean, I'd have to ... I'd have to....
ASTON. Well, I could tell you…
DAVIES. That's ... that's it ... you see…you get my meaning?
ASTON. When the time comes….
DAVIES. I mean, that's what I'm getting at, you see….
ASTON. More or less exactly what you…
DAVIES. You see, what I mean to say…what I'm getting at is ... I mean, what sort of jobs….
Pause.
ASTON. Well, there's things like the stairs... and the ... the bells... 
DAVIES. But it'd be a matter ... wouldn't it ... it'd be a matter of a broom ... isn't it?
ASTON. Yes, and of course, you'd need a few brushes.
DAVIES. You'd need implements ... you see… you'd need a good few implements..
ASTON takes a white overall from a nail over his bed, and
shows it to DAVIES.
ASTON. You could wear this, if you liked.
DAVIES. Well ... that's nice, en't?
ASTON. It'd keep the dust off.
DAVIES (putting it on). Yes, this'd keep the dust off, all right.
Well off. Thanks very much, mister.
ASTON. You see, what we could do, we could ... I could fit a bell at the bottom, outside the front door, with "Caretaker" on it. And you could answer any queries.
DAVIES. Oh, I don't know about that.
ASTON. Why not?
DAVIES. Well, I mean, you don't know who might come up them front steps, do you? I got to be a bit careful.
ASTON. Why, someone after you?
DAVIES. After me? Well, I could have that Scotch git coming looking after me, couldn't I? All I'd do, I'd hear the bell, I'd go down there, open the door, who might be there, any Harry might be there. I could be buggered as easy as that, man.
They might be there after my card, I mean look at it, here I am, I only got four stamps, on this card, here it is, look, four stamps, that's all I got, I ain't got any more, that's all i got, they ring the bell called Caretaker, they'd have me in, that's what they'd do, I wouldn't stand a chance. Of course I got plenty of other cards lying about, but they don't know that, and I can't tell them, can I, because then they'd find out I was going about under an assumed name. You see, the name I call myself now, that's not my real name. My real name's not the one I'm using, you see. It's different. You see, the name I go under now ain't my real one. It's assumed.
Silence.
THE LIGHTS FADE TO BLACKOUT.
THEN UP TO DIM LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW.
A door bangs.
Sound of a key in the door of the room.
DAVIES enters, closes the door, and tries the light swich, on, off, on, off.
DAVIES (muttering). What's this? (He switches on and off.)
What's the matter with this damn light? (He switches on and off-) Aaah. Don't tell me the damn light's gone now.
Pause.
What'll I do? Damn light's gone now. Can't see a thing.
Pause.
What'll I do now? (He moves, stumbles.) Ah God, what's that? Give me a light. Wait a minute.
He feels for matches in his pocket, takes out a box and lights one. The march goes our. The box falls.
Aah! Where is it? (Stooping.) Where's the bloody box?
The box is kicked.
What's that? What? Who's that? What's that?
Pause. He moves.
Where's my box? It was down here. Who's this? Who's moving it?
Silence.
Come on. Who's this? Who's this got my bor?
Pause.
Who's in here!
Pause.
I got a knife here. I'm ready. Come on then, who are you?
He moves, stumbles, falls and cries our.
Silence.
A faint whimper from DAVIES. He gets up.
All right!
He stands. Heavy breathing.
Suddenly the electrolux starts to hum. A figure moves with it, guiding it. The nosale moves along the floor after DAVIES, who skips, dives away from it and falls, breathlessly.
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Get away-y-y-y-y!
The electrolux stops. The figure jumps on ASTON's bed.
I'm ready for you! I'm ... I'm ... I'm here!
The figure takes out the electrolux plug from the light socket and fits the bulb. The light goes on. DAVIES flattens himself against right wall, knife in hand. MICK stands on the bed, holding the plug.
MICK. I was just doing some spring cleaning. (He gets down.) There used to be a wall plug for this electrolux. But it doesn't work. I had to fit it in the light socket. (He puts the electrolux under ASTON's bed.) How do you think the place is looking? I gave it a good going over.
Pause.
We take it in turns, once a fortnight, my brother and me, to give the place a thorough going over. I was working late to-night, I only just got here. But I thought I better get on with it, as it's my turn.
Pause.
It's not that I actually live here. I don't. As a matter of fact I live somewhere else. But after all, I'm responsible for the upkeep of the premises, en' I? Can't help being house-proud.
He moves towards DAVIES and indicates the knife.
What are you waving that about for?
DAVIES. You come near me….
MIck. I'm sorry if I gave you a start. But I had you in mind too, you know. I mean, my brother's guest. We got to think of your comfort, en't we? Don't want the dust to get up your nose. How long you thinking of staying here, by the way?
As a matter of fact, I was going to suggest that we'd lower your rent, make it just a nominal sum, I mean until you get fixed up. Just nominal, that's all.
Pause.
Still, if you're going to be spiky, I'll have to reconsider the whole proposition.
Pause.
Eh, you're not thinking of doing any violence on me, are you? You're not the violent sort, are you?
DAVIES (vehemently). I keep myself to myself, mate. But it anyone starts with me though, they know what they got coming.
MICK. I can believe that.
DAVIES. You do. I been all over, see? You understand my meaning? I don't mind a bit of a joke now and then, but anyone'll tell you... that no one starts anything with me.
MICK. I get what you mean, yes.
DAVIES. I can be pushed so far... but…
MICK. No further.
DAVIES. That's it.
MICK sits on junk down right.
What you doing?
MICk. No, I just want to say that... I'm very impressed by that.
DAVIES. Eh?
MICk. I'm very impressed by what you've just said.
Pause.
Yes, that's impressive, that is.
Pause.
I'm impressed, anyway.
DAVIES. You know what I'm talking about then?
MICK. Yes, I know. I think we understand one another.
DAVIES. Uh? Well…I'll tell you ... I'd ... I'd like to think that. You been playing me about, you know. I don't know why. I never done you no harm.
MICK. No, you know what it was? We just got off on the wrong foot. That's all it was.
DAVIES. Ay, we did.
DAVIES joins MICK in junk.
MICK. Like a sandwich?
DAVIES. What?
MICR (taking a sandwich from his pocket). Have one of these.
DAVIES. Don't you pull anything.
MICK. No, you're still not understanding me. I can't help being interested in any friend of my brother's. I mean, you're my brother's friend, aren't you?
DAVIES. Well, I ... I wouldn't put it as far as that.
MICR. Don't you find him friendly, then?
DAVIES. Well, I wouldn't say we was all that friends. I mean, he done me no harm, but I wouldn't say he was any particular friend of mine. What's in that sandwich, then?
MICK. Cheese.
DAVIES. That'll do me.
MICK. Take one.
DAVIES. Thank you, mister.
MICK. I'm sorry to hear my brother's not very friendly.
DAVIES. He's friendly, he's friendly, I didn't say he wasn't...
MICK (raking a salt-cellar from his pocket). Salt?
DAVIES. No thanks. (He munches the sandwich.) I just can't exactly ... make him out.
MICK (feeling in his pocket). I forgot the pepper.
DAVIES. Just can't get the hang of him, that's all.
MICk. I had a bit of beetroot somewhere. Must have mislaid it.
Pause.
DAVIES chews the sandwich. MICK watches him eat. He then rises and strolls downstage.
Uuh ... listen ... can I ask your advice? I mean, you're a man of the world. Can I ask your advice abour something?
DAVIES. You go right ahead.
MICk. Well, what it is, you see, I'm ... I'm a bit worried about my brother.
DAVIES. Your brother?
MICK. Yes... you see, his trouble is....
DAVIES. What?
MICK. Well, it's not a very nice thing to say....
DAVIES (rising, coming downstage). Go on now, you say it.
MICK looks at him.
MICK. He doesn't like work:
Pause.
DAVIES. Go on!
MICk. No, he just doesn't like work, that's his trouble.
DAVIES. Is that a fact?
MICk. It's a terrible thing to have to say about your own brother.
DAVIES. Ay.
MICK. He's just shy of it. Very shy of it.
DAVIES. I know that sort.
MICK. You know the type?
DAVIES. I've met them.
MICK. I mean, I want to get him going in the world.
DAVIES. Stands to reason, man.
MIck. If you got an older brother you want to push him on, you want to see him make his way. Can't have him idle, he's only doing himself harm. That's what I say.
DAVIES. Yes.
MICk. But he won't buckle down to the job.
DAVIES. He don't like work.
MIck. Work shy.
DAVIES. Sounds like it to me.
MICK. You've met the type, have you?
DAVIES. Me? I know that sort.
MICK. Yes.
DAVIES. I know that sort. I've met them.
MICK. Causing me great anxiety. You see, I'm a working man:
I'm a tradesman. I've got my own van.
DAVIES. Is that a fact?
MICK. He's supposed to be doing a little job for me ... I keep him here to do a little job... but I don't know ...
I'm coming to the conclusion he's a slow worker.
Pause.
What would your advice be?
DAVIES. Well... he's a funny bloke, your brother.
MICK. What?
DAVIES. I was saying, he's ... he's a bit of a funny bloke, your brother.
MICK stares at him.
MICK. Funny? Why?
DAVIES. Well... he's funny...
MICK. What's funny about him?
Pause.
DAVIES. Not liking work.
MICK. What's funny about that?
DAVIES. Nothing.
Pause.
MICk. I don't call it funny.
DAVIES. Nor me.
MICk. You don't want to start getting hypercritical.
DAVIES. No, no, I wasn't that, I wasn't ... I was only saying....
MICK. Don't get too glib.
DAVIES. Look, all I meant was
MICK. Cut it! (Briskly.) Look! I got a proposition to make to you. I'm thinking of taking over the running of this place, you see? I think it could be run a bit more efficiently. I got a lot of ideas, a lot of plans. (He eyes DAVIES.) How would you like to stay on here, as caretaker?
DAVIES. What?
MICK. I'll be quite open with you. I could rely on a man like you around the place, keeping an eye on things.
DAVIES. Well now …wait a minute ... I ... I ain't never done no caretaking before, you know... • MICR. Doesn't matter about that. It's just that you look a capable sort of man to me.
DAVIES. I am a capable sort of man. I mean to say, I've had plenty offers in my time, you know, there's no getting away from that.
MICK. Well, I could see before, when you took out that knife, that you wouldn't let anyone mess you about.
DAVIES. No one messes me about, man.
MICK. I mean, you've been in the services, haven't you?
DAVIES. The what?
MICK. You been in the services. You can tell by your stance.
DAVIES. Oh ... yes. Spent half my life there, man. Overseas... like ... serving... I was.
MICK. In the colonies, weren't you?
DAVIES. I was over there. I was one of the first over there.
MICk. That's it. You're just the man I been looking for.
DAVIES. What for?
MICK. Caretaker.
DAVIES. Yes, well … look… listen… who's the landlord here, him or you?
MICK. Me. I am. I got deeds to prove it.
DAVIES. Ah ... (Decisively.) Well listen, I don't mind doing a bit of caretaking, I wouldn't mind looking after the place for you.
MICk. Of course, we'd come to a small financial agreement, mutually beneficial.
DAVIES. I leave you to reckon that out, like.
MICk. Thanks. There's only one thing.
DAVIES. What's that?
MICk. Can you give me any references?
DAVIES. Eh?
MICk. Just to satisfy my solicitor.
DAVIES. I got plenty of references. All I got to do is to go down to Sidcup tomorrow. I got all the references I want down
there.
MICk. Where's that?
DAVIES. Sidcup. He ain't only got my references down there, he got all my papers down there. I know that place like the back of my hand. I'm going down there anyway, see what I mean, I got to get down there, or I'm done.
MICK. So we can always get hold of these references if we want them.
DAVIES. I'll be down there any day, I tell you. I was going down today, but I'm ... I'm waiting for the weather to break.
MICK. Ah.
DAVIES. Listen. You can't pick me up a pair of good shoes, can you? I got a bad need for a good pair of shoes. I can't get anywhere without a pair of good shoes, see? Do you think there's any chance of you being able to pick me up a pair?
THE LIGHTS FADE TO BLACKOUT.
LIGHTS UP. Morning.
ASTON is pulling on his trousers over long underwear. A slight grimace. He looks around at the head of his bed, rakes a towel from the rail and waves it about. He pulls it down, goes to DAVIES and wakes him. DAVIES sits up abruptly.
ASTON. You said you wanted me to get you up.
DAVIES. What for?
ASTON. You said you were thinking of going to Sidcup.
DAVIES. Ay, that'd be a good thing, if I got there.
ASTON. Doesn't look much of a day.
DAVIES. Ay, well, that's shot it, en't it?
ASTON. I ... I didn't have a very good night again.
DAVIES. I slept terrible.
Pause.
ASTON. You were making...
DAVIES. Terrible. Had a bit of rain in the night, didn't it?
ASTON. Just a bit.
He goes to his bed, picks up a small plank and begins to sandpaper it.
DAVIES. Thought so. Come in on my head.
Pause.
Draught's blowing right in on my head, anyway.
Pause.
Can't you close that window behind that sack?
ASTON. You could.
DAVIES. Well then, what about it, then? The rain's coming right in on my head.
ASTON. Got to have a bit of air.
DAVIES gets out of bed. He is wearing his trousers, waistcoat and vest.
DAVIES (putting on his sandals). Listen. I've lived all my life in the air, boy. You don't have to tell me about air. What I'm saying is, there's too much air coming in that window when I'm asleep.
ASTON. Gets very stuffy in here without that window open.
ASTON crosses to the chair, puts the plank on it, and continues sandpapering.
DAVIES. Yes, but listen, you don't know what I'm telling you.
That bloody rain, man, come right in on my head. Spoils my sleep. I could catch my death of cold with it, with that draught. That's all I'm saying. Just shut that window and no one's going to catch any colds, that's all I'm saying.
Pause.
ASTON. I couldn't sleep in here without that window open.
DAVIES. Yes, but what about me? What ... what you got to say about my position?
ASTON. Why don't you sleep the other way round?
DAVIES. What do you mean?
ASTON. Sleep with your feet to the window.
DAVIES. What good would that do?
ASTON. The rain wouldn't come in on your head.
DAVIES. No, I couldn't do that. I couldn't do that.
Pause.
I mean, I got used to sleeping this way. It isn't me has to change, it's that window. You see, it's raining now. Look at it. It's coming down now.
Pause.
ASTON. I think I'll have a walk down to Goldhawk Road. I got talking to a man there. He had a saw bench. It looked in pretty good condition to me. Don't think it's much good to him.
Pause.
Have a walk down there, I think.
DAVIES. Listen to that. That’s done my trip to Sidcup. Eh, what about closing that window now? It’ll be coming in here.
ASTON. Close it for the time being.
DAVIES closes the window and looks out.
DAVIES. What's all that under that tarpaulin out there?
ASTON. Wood.
DAVIES. What for?
ASTON. To build my shed.
DAVIES sits on his bed.
DAVIES. You haven't come across that pair of shoes you was going to look out for me, have you?
ASTON. Oh. No. I'll see if I can pick some up today.
DAVIES. I can't go out in this with these, can I? I can't even go out and get a cup of tea.
ASTON. There's a café just along the road.
DAVIES. There may be, mate.
During ASTON's speech the room grows darker.
By the close of the speech only ASTON can be seen clearly.
DAVIES and all the other objects are in the shadow. The fade-down of the light must be as gradual, as protracted and as unobtrusive as possible.
ASTON. I used to go there quite a bit. Oh, years ago now. But I stopped. I used to like that place. Spent quite a bit of time in there. That was before I went away. Just before. I think that... place had a lot to do with it. They were all ... a good bit older than me. But they always used to listen. I thought... they understood what I said. I mean I used to talk to them. I talked too much. That was my mistake. The same in the factory. Standing there, or in the breaks, I used to ... talk about things. And these men, they used to listen, whenever I ... had anything to say. It was all right. The trouble was, I used to have kind of hallucinations.
They weren't hallucinations, they ... I used to get the feeling I could see things... very clearly ... everything ... was so clear... everything used ... everything used to get very quiet... everything got very quiet... all this … quiet ... and ... this clear sight ... it was … but maybe I was wrong. Anyway, someone must have said something. I didn't know anything about it. And ... some kind of lie must have got around. And this lie went round. I thought people started being funny. In that café.
The factory. I couldn't understand it. Then one day they took me to a hospital, right outside London. They ... got me there. I didn't want to go. Anyway ... I tried to get out, quite a few times. But ... it wasn't very easy. They asked me questions, in there. Got me in and asked me all sorts of questions. Well, I told them ... when they wanted to know . .. what my thoughts were. Hmmnn.
Then one day ... this man ... doctor, I suppose the head one ... he was quite a man of ... distinction ... although I wasn't so sure about that. He called me in.
He said... he told me I had something. He said they'd concluded their examination. That's what he said. And he showed me a pile of papers and he said that I'd got some-thing, some complaint. He said... he just said that, you see. You've got ... this thing. That's your complaint.
And we've decided, he said, that in your interests there's only one course we can take. He said ... but I can't… exactly remember ... how he put it ... he said, we're going to do something to your brain. He said ... if we don't, you'll be in here for the rest of your life, but if we do, you stand a chance. You can go out, he said, and live like the others. What do you want to do to my brain, I said to him. But he just repeated what he'd said. Well, I wasn't a fool. I knew I was a minor. I knew he couldn't do anything to me without getting permission. I knew he had to get permission from my mother. So I wrote to her and told her what they were trying to do. But she signed their form, you see, giving them permission. I know that because he showed me her signature when I brought it up. Well, that night I tried to escape, that night. I spent five hours sawing at one of the bars on the window in this ward. Right throughout the dark. They used to shine a torch over the beds every half hour. So I timed it just right. And then it was nearly done, and a man had a ... he had a fit, right next to me.
And they caught me, anyway. About a week later they started to come round and do this thing to the brain. We were all supposed to have it done, in this ward. And they came round and did it one at a time. One a night. I was one of the last. And I could see quite clearly what they did to the others. They used to come round with these ... I don't know what they were ... they looked like big pincers, with wires on, the wires were attached to a little machine. It was electric. They used to hold the man down, and this chief ... the chief doctor, used to fit the pincers, something like earphones, he used to fit them on either side of the man's skull. There was a man holding the machine, you see, and he'd turn it on, and the chief would just press these pincers on either side of the skull and keep them there.
Then he'd take them off. They'd cover the man up ... and they wouldn't touch him again until later on. Some used to put up a fight, but most of them didn't. They just lay there. Well, they were coming round to me, and the night they came I got up and stood against the wall. They told me to get on the bed, and I knew they had to get me on the bed because if they did it while I was standing up they might break my spine. So I stood up and then one or two of them came for me, well, I was younger then, I was much stronger than I am now, I was quite strong then, I laid one of them out and I had another one round the throat, and then suddenly this chief had these pincers on my skull and I knew he wasn't supposed to do it while I was standing up, that's why I .... anyway, he did it. So I did get out. I got out of the place... but I couldn't walk very well. I don't think my spine was damaged. That was perfectly all right. The trouble was ... my thoughts... had become very slow ... I couldn't think at all ... I couldn't ... get ... my thoughts... together... uuuhh... I could... never quite get it ... together. The trouble was, I couldn't hear what people were saying. I couldn't look to the right or the left, I had to look straight in front of me, because if I turned my head round ... I couldn't keep ... upright. And I had these headaches. I used to sit in my room. That was when I lived with my mother. And my brother. He was younger than me. And I laid everything out, in order, in my room, all the things I knew were mine, but I didn't die. The thing is, I should have been dead. I should have died. Anyway, I feel much better now.
But I don't talk to people now. I steer clear of places like that café. I never go into them now. I don't talk to anyone ... like that. I've often thought of going back and trying to find the man who did that to me. But I want to do something first. I want to build that shed out in the garden.
Curtain


Two weeks later.
MICK is lying on the floor, down left, his head resting on the rolled carpet, looking up at the ceiling.
DAVIES is sitting in the chair, holding his pipe. He is wearing the smoking jacket. It is afternoon.
Silence.
DAVIES. I got a feeling he's done something to them cracks.
Pause.
See, there's been plenty of rain in the last week, but it ain't been dripping into the bucket.
Pause.
He must have tarred it over up there.
Pause.
There was someone walking about on the roof the other night. It must have been him.
Pause.
But I got a feeling he's tarred it over on the roof up there.
Ain't said a word to me about it. Don't say a word to me.
Pause.
He don't answer me when I talk to him.
He lights a march, holds it to his pipe, and blows it.
He don't give me no knife!
Pause.
He don't give me no knife to cut my bread.
Pause.
How can I cut a loaf of bread without no knife?
Pause.
It's an impossibility.
Pause.
MICK. You've got a knife.
DAVIES. What?
MICK. You've got a knife.
DAVIES. I got a knife, sure I got a knife, but how do you expect me to cut a good loaf of bread with that? That's not a bread-knife. It's nothing to do with cutting bread. I picked it up somewhere. I don't know where it's been, do I? No, what I want—
MICk. I know what you want.
Pause. DAVIES rises and goes to the gas stove.
DAVIES. What about this gas stove? He tells me it's not con-nected. How do I know it's not connected? Here I am, I'm sleeping right with it, I wake up in the middle of the night, I'm looking right into the oven, man! It's right next to my face, how do I know, I could be lying there in bed, it might blow up, it might do me harm!
Pause.
But he don't seem to take any notice of what I say to him.
I told him the other day, see, I told him about them Blacks, about them Blacks coming up from next door, and using the lavatory. I told him, it was all dirty in there, all the banisters were dirty, they were black, all the lavatory was black. But what did he do? He's supposed to be in charge of it here, he had nothing to say, he hadn't got a word to say.
Pause.
Couple of weeks ago... he sat there, he give me a long chat... about a couple of weeks ago. A long chat he give me. Since then he ain't said hardly a word. He went on talking there ... I don't know what he was ... he wasn't looking at me, he wasn't talking to me, he don't care about me. He was talking to himself! That's all he worries about. I mean, you come up to me, you ask my advice, he
wouldn't never do a thing like that. I mean, we don't have any conversation, you see? You can't live in the same room with someone who ... who don't have any conversation with you.
Pause.
I just can't get the hang of him.
Pause.
You and me, we could get this place going.
MICK (ruminatively). Yes, you're quite right. Look what I could do with this place.
Pause.
I could turn this place into a penthouse. For instance... this room. This room you could have as the kitchen. Right size, nice window, sun comes in. I'd have ... I'd have teal-blue, copper and parchment linoleum squares. I'd have those colours re-echoed in the walls. I'd offset the kitchen units with charcoal-grey worktops. Plenty of room for cupboards for the crockery. We'd have a small wall cupboard, a large wall cupboard, a corner wall cupboard with revolving shelves. You wouldn't be short of cupboards. You could put the dining-room across the landing, see? Yes. Venetian blinds on the window, cork floor, cork tiles. You could have an off-white pile linen rug, a table in ... in afromosia teak veneer, sideboard with matt black drawers, curved chairs with cushioned seats, armchairs in oatmeal tweed, a beech frame settee with a woven sea-grass seat, white-topped heat-resistant coffee table, white tile surround. Yes. Then the bedroom. What's a bedroom? It's a retreat. It's a place to go for rest and peace. So you want quiet decoration. The lighting functional. Furniture…mahogany and rosewood. Deep azure-blue carpet, unglazed blue and white curtains, a bedspread with a pattern of small blue roses on a white ground, dressing-table with a lift-up top containing a plastic tray, table lamp of white raffia... (MICK sits up.) it wouldn't be a flat it'd be a palace.
DAVIES. I'd say it would, man.
MICK. A palace.
DAVIES. Who would live there?
MICK. I would. My brother and me.
Pause.
DAVIES. What about me?
MICK (quietly). All this junk here, it's no good to anyone. It's just a lot of old iron, that's all. Clobber. You couldn't make a home out of this. There's no way you could arrange it. It's junk. He could never sell it, either, he wouldn't get tuppence for it.
Pause.
Junk.
Pause.
But he doesn't seem to be interested in what I got in mind, that's the trouble. Why don't you have a chat with him, see if he's interested?
DAVIES. Me?
MICK. Yes. You're a friend of his.
DAVIES. He's no friend of mine.
MICK. You're living in the same room with him, en't you?
DAVIES. He's no friend of mine. You don't know where-you are with him. I mean, with a bloke like you, you know where you are.
MICK looks at him.
I mean, you got your own ways, I'm not saying you ain't got your own ways, anyone can see that. You may have some funny ways, but that's the same with all of us, but with him it's different, see? I mean at least with you, the thing with you is you're...
MICK. Straightforward.
DAVIES. That's it, you're straightforward.
MICK. Yes.
DAVIES. But with him, you don't know what he's up to half the time!
MICK. Uh.
DAVIES. He's got no feelings!
Pause.
See, what I need is a clock! I need a clock to tell the time!
How can I tell the time without a clock? I can't do it! I said to him, I said, look here, what about getting in a clock, so's I can tell what time it is? I mean, if you can't tell what time you're at you don't know where you are, you understand my meaning? See, what I got to do now, if I'm walking about outside, I got to get my eye on a clock, and keep the time in my head for when I come in. But that's no good, I mean I'm not in here five minutes and I forgotten it. I forgotten what time it was!
DAVIES walks up and down the room.
Look at it this way. If I don't feel well I have a bit of a lay down, then, when I wake up, I don't know what time it is to go and have a cup of tea! You see, it's not so bad when I'm coming in. I can see the clock on the corner, the moment I'm stepping into the house I know what the time is, but when I'm in! It's when I'm in ... that I haven't the foggiest idea what time it is!
Pause.
No, what I need is a clock in here, in this room, and then I stand a bit of a chance. But he don't give me one.
DAVIES sits in the chair.
He wakes me up! He wakes me up in the middle of the night! Tells me I'm making noises! I tell you I've half a mind to give him a mouthful one of these days.
MICK. He don't let you sleep?
DAVIES. He don't let me sleep! He wakes me up!
MICK. That's terrible.
DAVIES. I been plenty of other places. They always let me sleep. It's the same the whole world over. Except here.
MICK. Sleep's essential. I've always said that.
DAVIES. You're right, it's essential. I get up in the morning, I'm worn out! I got business to see to. I got to move myself, I got to sort myself out, I got to get fixed up. But when I wake up in the morning, I ain't got no energy in me. And on top of that I ain't got no clock.
MICK. Yes.
DAVIES (standing, moving). He goes out, I don't know where he goes to, where's he go, he never tells me. We used to have a bit of a chat, not any more. I never see him, he goes out, he comes in late, next thing I know he's shoving me about in the middle of the night.
Pause.
Listen! I wake up in the morning ... I wake up in the morning and he's smiling at me! He's standing there, looking at me, smiling! I can see him, you see, I can see him through the blanket. He puts on his coat, he turns himself round, he looks down at my bed, there's a smile on his face!
What the hell's he smiling at? What he don't know is that I'm watching him through that blanket. He don't know that!
He don't know I can see him, he thinks I'm asleep, but 1 got my eye on him all the time through the blanket, see? But he don't know that! He just looks at me and he smiles, but he don't know that I can see him doing it!
Pause.
(Bending, close to MICK.) No, what you want to do, you want to speak to him, see? I got ... I got that worked out. You want to tell him ... that we got ideas for this place, we could build it up, we could get it started. You see, I could decorate it out for you, I could give you a hand in doing it ... between us.
Pause.
Where do you live now, then?
MICK. Me? Oh, I've got a little place. Not bad. Everything laid on. You must come up and have a drink some time.
Listen to some Tchaikovsky.
DAVIES. No, you see, you're the bloke who wants to talk to him. I mean, you're his brother.
Pause.
MICK. Yes... maybe I will.
A door bangs.
MICK rises, goes to the door and exits.
DAVIES. Where you going? This is him!
Silence.
DAVIES stands, then goes to the window and looks out.
ASTON enters. He is carrying a paper bag. He takes off his overcoat, opens the bag and takes out a pair of shoes.
ASTON. Pair of shoes.
DAVIES (turning). What?
ASTON. I picked them up. Try them.
DAVIES. Shoes? What sort?
ASTON. They might do you.
DAVIES comes down stage, takes off his sandals and tries the shoes on. He walks about, waggling his feet, bends, and presses the leather.
DAVIES. No, they're not right.
ASTON. Aren't they?
DAVIES. No, they don't fit.
ASTON. Mmon.
Pause.
DAVIES. Well, I'll tell you what, they might do… until I get another pair.
Pause.
Where's the laces?
ASTON. No laces.
DAVIES. I can't wear them without laces.
ASTON. I just got the shoes.
DAVIES. Well now, look that puts the lid on it, don't it?
I mean, you couldn't keep these shoes on right without a pair of laces. The only way to keep a pair of shoes on, if you haven't got no laces, is to tighten the foot, see? Walk about with a tight foot, see? Well, that's no good for the foot. Puts a bad strain on the foot. If you can do the shoes up proper there's less chance of you getting a strain.
ASTON goes round to the top of his bed.
ASTON. I might have some somewhere.
DAVIES. You see what I'm getting at?
Pause.
ASTON. Here's some. (He hands them to DAVIES.) DAVIES. These are brown.
ASTON. That's all I got.
DAVIES. These shoes are black.
ASTON does not answer.
Well, they can do, anyway, until I get another pair.
DAVIES sits in the chair and begins to lace his shoes.
Maybe they'll get me down to Sidcup tomorrow. If I get down there I'll be able to sort myself out.
Pause.
I've been offered a good job. Man has offered it to me, he's ... he's got plenty of ideas. He's got a bit of a future. But they want my papers, you see, they want my references. I'd have to get down to Sidcup before I could get hold of them.
That's where they are, see. Trouble is, getting there. That's my problem. The weather's dead against it.
ASTON quietly exits, unnoticed.
Don't know as these shoes'll be much good. It's a hard road, I been down there before. Coming the other way, like. Last time I left there, it was ... last time... getting on a while back. the road was bad, the rain was coming down, lucky I didn't die there on the road, but I got here, I kept going, all along... yes ... I kept going all along.
But all the same, I can't go on like this, what I got to do, I got to get back there, find this man-He turns and looks about the room.
Christ! That bastard, he ain't even listening to me!
BLACKOUT.
DIM LIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW.
It is night. ASTON and DAVIES are in bed, DAVIES groaning.
ASTON sits up, gets out of bed, switches on the light, goes over to DAVIES and shakes him.
ASTON. Hey, stop it, will you? I can't sleep.
DAVIES. What? What? What's going on?
ASTON. You're making noises.
DAVIES. I'm an old man, what do you expect me to do, stop breathing?
ASTON. You're making noises.
DAVIES. What do you expect me to do, stop breathing?
ASTON goes to his bed, and puts on his trousers.
ASTON. I'll get a bit of air.
DAVIES. What do you expect me to do? I tell you, mate, I'm not surprised they took you in. Waking an old man up in the middle of the night, you must be off your nut! Giving me bad dreams, who's responsible, then, for me having bad dreams? If you wouldn't keep mucking me about I wouldn't make no noises! How do you expect me to sleep peaceful when you keep poking me all the time? What do you want me to do, stop breathing?
He throws the cover off and gets out of bed, wearing his vest, waistcoat and trousers.
It's getting so freezing in here I have to keep my trousers on to go to bed. I never done that before in my life. But that's what I got to do here. Just because you won't put in any bleeding heating! I've had just about enough with you mucking me about. I've seen better days than you have, man.
Nobody ever got me inside one of them places, anyway. I'm a sane man! So don't you start mucking me about. I'll be all right as long as you keep your place. Just you keep your place, that's all. Because I can tell you, your brother's got his eye on you. He knows all about you. I got a friend there, don't you worry about that. I got a true pal there. Treating me like dirt! Why'd you invite me in here in the first place if you was going to treat me like this? You think you're better than me you got another think coming. I know enough.
They had you inside one of them places before, they can have you inside again. Your brother's got his eye on you! They can put the pincers on your head again, man! They can have them on again! Any time. All they got to do is get the word. They'd carry you in there, boy. They'd come here and pick you up and carry you in! They'd keep you fixed! They'd put them pincers on your head, they'd have you fixed!
They'd take one look at all this junk I got to sleep with they'd know you were a creamer. That was the greatest mistake they made, you take my tip, letting you get out of that place. Nobody knows what you're at, you go out you come in, nobody knows what you're at! Well, nobody messes me about for long. You think I'm going to do your dirty work? Haaaaahhhhh! You better think again! You want me to do all the dirty work all up and down them stairs just so I can sleep in this lousy filthy hole every night? Not me, boy. Not for you boy. You don't know what you're doing half the time. You're up the creek! You're half off! You can tell it by looking at you. Who ever saw you slip me a few bob? Treating me like a bloody animal! I never been inside a nuthouse!
ASTON makes a slight move towards him. DAVIES takes his knife from his back pocket.
Don't come nothing with me, mate. I got this here. I used it. I used it. Don't come it with me.
A pause. They stare at each other.
Mind what you do now.
Pause.
Don't you try anything with me.
Pause.
ASTON. I ... I think it's about time you found somewhere else. I don't think we're hitting it off.
DAVIES. Find somewhere else?
ASTON. Yes.
DAVIES. Me? You talking to me? Not me, man! You!
ASTON. What?
DAVIES. You! You better find somewhere else!
ASTON. I live here. You don't.
DAVIES. Don't I? Well, I live here. I been offered a job here.
ASTON. Yes... well, I don't think you're really suitable.
DAVIES. Not suitable? Well, I can tell you, there's someone here thinks I am suitable. And I'll tell you. I'm staying on here as caretaker! Get it! Your brother, he's told me, see, he's told me the job is mine. Mine! So that's where I am. I'm going to be his caretaker.
ASTON. My brother?
DAVIES. He's staying, he's going to run this place, and I'm staying with him.
ASTON. Look. If I give you... a few bob you can get down to Sidcup.
DAVIES. You build your shed first! A few bob! When I can earn a steady wage here! You build your stinking shed first!
That's what!
ASTON stares at him.
ASTON. That's not a stinking shed.
Silence.
ASTON moves to him.
It's clean. It's all good wood. I'll get it up. No trouble.
DAVIES. Don't come too near!
ASTON. You've no reason to call that shed stinking.
DAVIES points the knife.
You stink.
DAVIES. What!
ASTON. You've been stinking the place out.
DAVIES. Christ, you say that to me!
ASTON. For days. That's one reason I can't sleep.
DAVIES. You call me that! You call me stinking!
ASTON. You better go.
DAVIES. I'LL STINK YOU!
He thrusts his arm out, the arm trembling, the knife pointing at ASTON's stomach. ASTON does not move. Silence.
DAVIES' arm moves no further. They stand.
I’ll stink you...
Pause.
ASTON. Get your stuff.
DAVIES draws the knife in to his chest, breathing heavily.
ASTON goes to DAVIES' bed, collects his bag and puts a jew
of DAVIES' things into it.
DAVIES. You ain't ... you ain't got the right ... Leave that alone, that's mine!
DAVIES takes the bag and presses the contents down.
All right... I been offered a job here... you wait… (He purs on his smoking-jacket.) .. you wait ... your brother ... he'll sort you out ... you call me that… you call me that... no one's ever called me that… (He puts on his overcoat.) You'll be sorry you called me that… you ain't heard the last of this... (He picks up his bag and goes to the door.) You'll be sorry you called me that… 
He opens the door, ASTON watching him.
Now I know who I can trust.
DAVIES goes out. ASTON stands.
BLACKOUT.
LIGHTS UP. Early evening.
Voices on the stairs.
MICK and DAVIES enter.
DAVIES. Stink! You hear that! Me! I told you what he said, didn't I? Stink! You hear that? That's what he said to me!
MICK. Tch, tch, tch.
DAVIES. That's what he said to me.
MICR. You don't stink.
DAVIES. No, sir!
MIck. If you stank I'd be the first one to tell you.
DAVIES. I told him, I told him he ... I said to him, you ain't heard the last of this man! I said, don't you forget your brother. I told him you'd be coming along to sort him out.
He don't know what he's started, doing that. Doing that to me. I said to him, I said to him, he'll be along, your brother'll be along, he's got sense, not like you—
MICK. What do you mean?
DAVIES. Eh?
MICK. You saying my brother hasn't got any sense?
DAVIES. What? What I'm saying is, you got ideas for this place, all this... all this decorating, see? I mean, he's got no right to order me about. I take orders from you, I do my caretaking for you, I mean, you look upon me . . • you don't treat me like a lump of dirt... we can both . .. we can both see him for what he is.
Pause.
MICK. What did he say then, when you told him I'd offered you the job as caretaker?
DAVIES. He ... he said ... he said ... something about... he lived here.
MICK. Yes, he's got a point, en he?
DAVIES. A point! This is your house, en't? You let him live here!
MICk. I could tell him to go, I suppose.
DAVIES. That's what I'm saying.
MICK. Yes. I could tell him to go. I mean, I'm the landlord.
On the other hand, he's the sitting tenant. Giving him notice, you see, what it is, it's a technical matter, that's what it is. It depends how you regard this room. I mean it depends whether you regard this room as furnished or un-furnished. See what I mean?
DAVIES. No, I don't.
MICk. All this furniture, you see, in here, it's all his, except the beds, of course. So what it is, it's a fine legal point, that's what it is.
Pause.
DAVIES. I tell you he should go back where he come from!
MICK (turning to look at him). Come from?
DAVIES. Yes.
MICk. Where did he come from?
DAVIES. Well… he… he…
MICK. You get a bit out of your depth sometimes, don't you?
Pause.
(Rising, briskly.) Well, anyway, as things stand, I don't mind having a go at doing up the place....
DAVIES. That's what I wanted to hear!
MICK. No, I don't mind.
He turns to face DAVIES.
But you better be as good as you say you are.
DAVIES. What do you mean?
MICK. Well, you say you're an interior decorator, you'd better be a good one.
DAVIES. A what?
MICK. What do you mean, a what? A decorator. An interior decorator.
DAVIES. Me? What do you mean? I never touched that. I never been that.
MICK. You've never what?
DAVIES. No, no, not me, man. I'm not an interior decorator. I been too busy. Too many other things to do, you see. But I… but I could always turn my hand to most things… give me… give me a bit of time to pick it up.
MICK. I don't want you to pick it up. I want a first-class experienced interior decorator. I thought you were one.
DAVIES. Me? Now wait a minute— wait a minute— you got the wrong man.
MICK. How could I have the wrong man? You're the only man I've spoken to. You're the only man I've told, about my dreams, about my deepest wishes, you're the only one I've told, and I only told you because I understood you were an experienced first-class professional interior and exterior decorator.
DAVIES. Now look here
MICK. You mean you wouldn't know how to fit teal-blue, copper and parchment linoleum squares and have those colours re-echoed in the walls?
DAVIES. Now, look here, where'd you get—?
MICK. You wouldn't be able to decorate out a table in afro-mosia teak veneer, an armchair in oatmeal tweed and a beech frame settee with a woven sea-grass seat?
DAVIES. I never said that!
MICK. Christ! I must have been under a false impression!
DAVIES. I never said it!
MICK. You're a bloody impostor, mate!
DAVIES. Now you don't want to say that sort of thing to me.
You took me on here as caretaker. I was going to give you a helping hand, that's all, for a small . . for a small wage, I never said nothing about that ... you start calling me
names—
MICK. What is your name?
DAVIES. Don't start that—
MICk. No, what's your real name?
DAVIES. My real name's Davies.
MIck. What's the name you go under?
DAVIES. Jenkins!
MICk. You got two names. What about the rest? Eh? Now come on, why did you tell me all this dirt about you being an interior decorator?
DAVIES. I didn't tell you nothing! Won't you listen to what I'm saying?
Pause.
It was him who told you. It was your brother who must have told you. He's nutty! He'd tell you anything, out of spite, he's nutty, he's half way gone, it was him who told you.
MICK walks slowly to him.
MICK. What did you call my brother?
DAVIES. When?
MICK. He's what?
DAVIES. I ... now get this straight....
MICK. Nutty? Who's nutty?
Pause.
Did you call my brother nutty? My brother. That's a bit of .... that's a bit of an impertinent thing to say, isn't it?
DAVIES. But he says so himself!
MICK walks slowly round DAVIES' figure, regarding him, once. He circles him, once.
MICK. What a strange man you are. Aren't you? You're really strange. Ever since you come into this house there's been nothing but trouble. Honest. I can take nothing you say at face value. Every word you speak is open to any number of different interpretations. Most of what you say is lies. You're violent, you're erratic, you're just completely unpredictable. You're nothing else but a wild animal, when you come down
to it. You're a barbarian. And to put the old tin lid on it, you stink from arse-hole to breakfast time. Look at it. You come here recommending yourself as an interior decorator, whereupon I take you on, and what happens? You make a long speech about all the references you've got down at Sidcup, and what happens? I haven't noticed you go down to Sidcup to obtain them. It's all most regrettable but it looks as though I'm compelled to pay you off for your caretaking work. Here's half a dollar. He feels in his pocket, takes out a half-crown and tosses it at DAVIES' feet. DAVIES stands still. MICK walks to the gas stove and picks up the Buddha.
DAVIES (slowly). All right then ... you do that ... you do it ... if that's what you want… MICK. THAT'S WHAT I WANT!
He hurls the Buddha against the gas stove. It breaks.
(Passionarely.) Anyone would think this house was all I got to worry about. I got plenty of other things I can worry about. I've got other things. I've got plenty of other interests.
I've got my own business to build up, haven't I? I got to think about expanding ... in all directions. I don't stand still. I'm moving about, all the time. I'm moving ... all the time. I've got to think about the future. I'm not worried about this house. I'm not interested. My brother can worry about it. He can do it up, he can decorate it, he can do what he likes with it. I'm not bothered. I thought I was doing him a favour, letting him live here. He's got his own ideas.
Let him have them. I'm going to chuck it in.
Pause.
DAVIES. What about me?
Silence. MICK does not look at him.
A door bangs.
Silence. They do not move.
ASTON comes in. He closes the door, moves into the room and faces MICK. They look at each other. Both are smiling, faintly.
MICK (beginning to speak to ASTON). Look... uh… He stops, goes to the door and exits. ASTON leaves the door open, crosses behind DAVIES, sees the broken Buddha, and looks at the pieces for a moment. He then goes to his bed, rakes off his overcoat, sits, takes the screwdriver and plug and pokes the plug.
DAVIES. I just come back for my pipe.
ASTON. On yes.
DAVIES. I got out and ... half way down I ... I suddenly ... found out ... you see... that I hadn't got my pipe. So I come back to get it....
Pause. He moves to ASTON.
That ain't the same plug, is it, you been ...?
Pause.
Still can't get anywhere with it, eh?
Pause.
Well, if you… persevere, in my opinion, you'll probably ...
Pause.
Listen…
Pause.
You didn't mean that, did you, about me stinking, did you?
Pause.
Did you? You been a good friend to me. You took me in.
You took me in, you didn't ask me no questions, you give me a bed, you been a mate to me. Listen. I been thinking, why I made all them noises, it was because of the draught, see, that draught was on me as I was sleeping, made me make noises without me knowing it, so I been thinking, what I mean to say, if you was to give me your bed, and you have my bed, there's not all that difference between them, they're the same sort of bed, if I was to have your, you sleep, wherever bed you're in, so you have mine, I have your, and that'll be all right, I'll be out of the draught, see, I mean, you don't mind a bit of wind, you need a bit of air, I can understand that, you being in that place that time, with all them doctors and all they done, closed up, I know them places, too hot, you see, they're always too hot, I had a peep in one once, nearly suffocated me, so I reckon that'd be the best way out of it, we swap beds, and then we could get down to what we was saying, I'd look after the place for you, I'd keep an eye on it for you, for you, like, not for the other... not for ... for your brother, you see, not for him, for you, I'll be your man, you say the word, just say the word....
Pause.
What do you think of this I'm saying?
Pause.
ASTON. No, I like sleeping in this bed.
DAVIES. But you don't understand my meaning!
ASTON. Anyway, that one's my brother's bed.
DAVIES. Your brother?
ASTON. Any time he stays here. This is my bed. It's the only bed I can sleep in.
DAVIES. But your brother's gone! He's gone!
Pause.
ASTON. No. I couldn't change beds.
DAVIES. But you don't understand my meaning!
ASTON. Anyway, I'm going to be busy. I've got that shed to get up. If I don't get it up now it'll never go up. Until it's up I can't get started.
DAVIES. I'll give you a hand to put up your shed, that's what
I'll do!
Pause.
I'll give you a hand! We'll both put up that shed together!
See? Get it done in next to no time! Do you see what I'm saying?
Pause.
ASTON. No. I can get it up myself.
DAVIES. But listen. I'm with you, I'll be here, I'll do it for you!
Pause.
We'll do it together!
Pause.
Christ, we'll change beds!
ASTON moves to the window and stands with his back to DAVIES.
You mean you're throwing me out? You can't do that.
Listen man, listen man, I don't mind, you see, I don't mind, I'll stay, I don't mind, I'll tell you what, if you don't want to change beds, we'll keep it as it is, I'll stay in the same bed, maybe if I can get a stronger piece of sacking, like, to go over the window, keep out the draught, that'll do it, what do you say, we'll keep it as it is?
Pause.
ASTON. No.
DAVIES. Why ... not?
ASTON turns to look at him.
ASTON. You make too much noise.
DAVIES. But... but... look... listen… listen here… I mean... 
ASTON turns back to the window.
What am I going to do?
Pause.
What shall I do?
Pause.
Where am I going to go?
Pause.
If you want me to go... I'll go. You just say the word.
Pause.
I'll tell you what though... them shoes... them shoes you give me... they're working out all right ... they're all right. Maybe I could… get down… ASTON remains still, his kack to him, at the window.
Listen… if I… got down… if I was to… get my papers... would you ... would you let ... would you ... if l got down... and got my....
Long silence.
Curtain.
The two main areas are:
1. a room in LEN's house. Solid middle-European furniture.
Piles of books. A small carved table with a chenille cloth, a bowl of fruit, books. Two marquetry chairs. A hanging lamp with dark shade.
2. the living room in MARK's flat. Quite modern. Comfor-table. Two armchairs and a coffee table.
There is also a central downstage area of isolation and, for a short scene later in the play, a bed in a hospital, upstage on a higher level.
LEN, PETE and MARK are all in their late twenties.
MARK's room, midnight. Lamps are alight. Two cups and saucers, a sugar-bowl and a teapot are on a tray on the coffee table.
PETE is sitting, reading.
LEN is playing a recorder. The sound is fragmentary.
LEN: Pete.
PETE: What?
LEN: Come here.
PETE: What?
LEN: What's the matter with this recorder? [He pulls recorder in half, looks down, blows, taps.] There's something wrong with this recorder.
PETE: Let's have some tea.
LEN: I can't do a thing with it.
[Re-assembles recorder. Another attempt to play.]
Where's the milk?
[He puts recorder on tray.]
PETE: You were going to bring it.
LEN: That's right.
PETE: Well, where is it?
LEN: I forgot it. Why didn't you remind me?
PETE: Give me the cup.
LEN: What do we do now?
PETE: Give me the tea.
LEN: Without milk?
PETE: There isn't any milk.
LEN: What about sugar? [Moving towards door.] He must have a pint of milk somewhere. [He exits to kitchen. Noise of opening cupboards etc. He reappears with a couple of gherkins in a jar.] Here's a couple of gherkins. What about a gherkin? [Takes jar to PETE.] Fancy a gherkin. [PETE sniffs, looks up in disgust. LEN sniffs and exits.] Wait a minute.
[Kitchen noises. LEN reappears with a bottle of milk.] Ah!
Here we are. I knew he'd have a pint laid on. [Pressing the top.] Uuh! Uuuhh.... It's stiff.
PETE: I wouldn't open that.
LEN: Uuuhh .... why not? I can't drink tea without milk.
Uuh! That's it. [Picking up cup to pour.] Give us your cup.
PETE: Leave it alone.
[Pause. LEN shakes bottle over cup.]
LEN: It won't come out. [Pause.) The milk won't come out of the bottle.
PETE: It's been in there two weeks, why should it come out?
LEN: Two weeks? He's been away longer than two weeks.
[Slight pause.] It's stuck in the bottle. [Slight pause.]
You'd think a man like him would have a maid, wouldn't you, to look after the place while he's away, to look after his milk? Or a gentleman. A gentleman's gentleman. Are you quite sure he hasn't got a gentleman's gentleman tucked away somewhere, to look after the place for him?
PETE [rising to replace book on shelf: Only you. You're the only gentleman's gentleman he's got.
[Pause.]
LEN: Well, if I'm his gentleman's gentleman, I should have been looking after the place for him.
[Pause. PETE takes brass toasting fork off wall.]
PETE: What's this?
LEN: That? You've seen that before. It's a toasting fork.
PETE: It's got a monkey's head.
LEN: It's Portuguese. Everything in this house is Portuguese.
PETE: Why's that?
LEN: That's where he comes from.
PETE: Does he?
LEN: Or at least, his grandmother on his father's side. That's where the family comes from.
PETE: Well, well.
[He hangs up the toasting fork.]
LEN: What time's he coming?
PETE: Soon.
He pours himself a cup of tea.]
LEN: You're drinking black tea.
PETE: What about it?
LEN: You're not in Poland.
[He plays recorder. PETE sits in armchair.]
PETE: What's the matter with that thing?
LEN: Nothing. There's nothing wrong with it. But it must be broken. It's a year since I played it. (He sneezes.] Aah! I've got the most shocking blasted cold I've ever had in all my life.
[He blows his nose.] Still, it's not much of a nuisance really.
PETE: Don't wear me out. [Slight pause.] Why don't you pull yourself together? You'll be ready for the loony bin next week if you go on like this.
[LEN uses recorder as a telescope to the back of PETE's head.]
[Pause.]
LEN: Ten to one he'll be hungry.
PETE: Who?
LEN: Mark. When he comes. He can eat like a bullock, that bloke. Still, he won't find much to come home to, will he?
There's nothing in the kitchen, there's not even a bit of lettuce. It's like the workhouse here. [Pause.] He can eat like a bullock, that bloke. [Pause.] I've seen him finish off a loaf of bread before I'd got my jacket off. [Pause.] He'd never leave a breadcrumb on a plate in the old days. [Pause.] Of course, he may have changed. Things do change. But I'm the same. Do you know, I had five solid square meals one day last week? At eleven o'clock, two o'clock, six o'clock, ten o'clock and one o'clock. Not bad going. Work makes me hungry. I was working that day. [Pause.] I'm always starving when I get up. Daylight has a funny effect on me. As for the night, that goes without saying. As far as I'm concerned the only thing you can do in the night is eat. It keeps me fit, especially if I'm at home. I have to run downstairs to put the kettle on, run upstairs to finish what I'm doing, run downstairs to cut a sandwich or arrange a salad, run upstairs to finish what I'm doing, run back downstairs to see to the sausages, if I'm having sausages, run back upstairs to finish what I'm doing, run back downstairs to lay the table, run back upstairs to finish what I'm doing, run back—
PETE: Yes!
LEN: Where did you get those shoes?
PETE: What?
LEN: Those shoes. How long have you had them?
PETE: What's the matter with them?
LEN: Have you been wearing them all night?
[Pause.]
PETE: When did you last sleep?
[His hand is lying open, palm upward.]
LEN: Sleep? Don't make me laugh. All I do is sleep.
PETE: What about work? How's work?
LEN: Paddington? It's a big railway station. An oven. It's an oven. Still, bad air is better than no air. It's best on night shift. The trains come in, I give a bloke half a dollar, he does my job, I curl up in the corner and read the timetables.
But they tell me I might make a first class porter. I've been told I've got the makings of a number one porter. What are you doing with your hand?
PETE: What are you talking about?
LEN: What are you doing with your hand?
PETE (coolly]: What do you think I'm doing with it? Eh?
What do you think?
LEN: I don't know.
PETE: I'll tell you, shall IP Nothing. I'm not doing anything with it. It's not moving. I'm doing nothing with it.
LEN: You're holding it palm upwards.
PETE: What about it?
LEN: It's not normal. Let's have a look at that hand. Let's have a look at it. [Pause. He gasps through his teeth.] You're a homicidal maniac.
PETE: Is that a fact?
LEN: Look. Look at that hand. Look, look at it. A straight line right across the middle. Right across the middle, see?
Horizontal. That's all you've got. What else have you got?
You're a nut.
PETE: Oh yes?
LEN: You couldn't find two men in a million with a hand like that. It sticks out a mile. A mile. That's what you are, that's exactly what you are, you're a homicidal maniac!
[A knock on the outer door.]
PETE [rising to exit]: That's him. [He goes off. The lights begin
to fade to blackout.]
MARK: (of Anyone here?
PETE: [off] Yes, how are you?
MARK: [off) Any tea?
PETE: [off] Polish tea.
[Blackout. The lights come up in LEN'sroom-overhead lamp.
LEN is sitting at the side of the table.]
LEN: There is my table. That is a table. There is my chair.
There is my table. That is a bowl of fruit. There is my chair.
There are my curtains. There is no wind. It is past night and before morning. This is my room. This is a room.
There is the wall-paper, on the walls. There are six walls.
Eight walls. An octagon. This room is an octagon.
There are my shoes, on my feet.
This is a journey and an ambush. This is the centre of the cold, a halt to the journey and no ambush. This is the deep grass I keep to. This is the thicket in the centre of the night and the morning. There is my hundred watt bulb like a dagger. This room moves. This room is moving. It has moved. It has reached ... a dead halt. This is my fixture.
There is no web. All's clear, and abundant. Perhaps a morning will arrive. If a morning arrives, it will not destroy my fixture, nor my luxury. If it is dark in the night or light, nothing obtrudes. I have my compartment. I am wedged.
Here is my arrangement, and my kingdom. There are no voices. They make no hole in my side.
The doorbell rings. LEN searches for his glasses on the table, rummaging among the books. Lifts tablecloth. Is still. Searches in armchair. Then on mantlepiece. Bell rings again. He searches under table. Bell rings again. He rises, looks down, sees glasses in top pocket of jacket. Smiles, puts them on. Exits to open front door. MARK enters to below table. LEN follows.
LEN: What's this, a suit? Where's your carnation?
MARK: What do you think of it?
LEN: It's not a schmutta.
MARK: It's got a zip at the hips.
LEN: A zip at the hips? What for?
MARK: Instead of a buckle. It's neat.
LEN: Neat? I should say it's neat.
MARK: No turn-ups.
LEN: I can see that. Why didn't you have turn-ups?
MARK: It's smarter without turn-ups.
LEN: Of course it's smarter without turn-ups.
MARK: I didn't want it double-breasted.
LEN: Double-breasted? Of course you couldn't have it double-breasted.
MARK: What do you think of the cloth?
LEN: The cloth? [He examines it, gasps and whistles through his teeth. At a great pace.] What a piece of cloth. What a piece of cloth. What a piece of cloth. What a piece of cloth.
What a piece of cloth.
MARK: You like the cloth?
LEN: WHAT A PIECE OF CLOTH!
MARK: What do you think of the cut?
LEN: What do I think of the cut? The cut? The cut? What a cut! What a cut! I've never seen such a cut! [Pause.] [He sits and groans.]
MARK [combing his hair and sitting]: Do you know where I've just been?
LEN: Where?
MARK: Earls Court.
LEN: Uuuuhh! What were you doing there? That's beside the
point.
MARK: What's the matter with Earl's Court?
LEN: It's a mortuary without a corpse. [Pause.] There's a time and place for everything...
MARK: You're right there.
LEN: What do you mean by that?
MARK: There's a time and place for everything.
LEN: You're right there. [Puts glasses on, rises to Mark.] Who have you been with? Actors and actresses? What's it like when you act? Does it please you? Does it please anyone else?
MARK: What's wrong with acting?
LEN: It's a time-honoured profession-it's time-honoured.
[Pause.] But what does it do? Does it please you when you walk onto a stage and everybody looks up and watches you?
Maybe they don't want to watch you at all. Maybe they'd prefer to watch someone else. Have you ever asked them?
[MARK chuckles.] You should follow my example and take up mathematics. [Showing him open book.] Look! All last night I was working at mechanics and determinants. There's nothing like a bit of calculus to cheer you up.
Pause.
MARK: I'll think about it.
LEN: Have you got a telephone here?
MARK: It's your house.
LEN: Yes. What are you doing here? What do you want here?
MARK: I thought you might give me some bread and honey.
LEN: I don't want you to become too curious in this room.
There's no place for curiosities here. Keep a sense of proportion. That's all I ask.
MARK: That's all.
LEN: I've got enough on my plate with this room as it is.
MARK: What's the matter with it?
LEN: The rooms we live in ... open and shut. [Pause.] Can't you see? They change shape at their own will. I wouldn't grumble if only they would keep to some consistency. But they don't. And I can't tell the limits, the boundaries, which I've been led to believe are natural. I'm all for the natural behaviour of rooms, doors, staircases, the lot. But I can't rely on them. When, for example, I look through a train window, at night, and see the yellow lights, very clearly, I can see what they are, and I see that they're still. But they're only still because I'm moving. I know that they do move along with me, and when we go round a bend, they bump off. But I know that they are still, just the same. They are, after all, stuck on poles which are rooted to the earth. So they must be still, in their own right, insofar as the earth itself is still, which of course it isn't. The point is, in a nutshell, that I can only appreciate such facts when I'm moving. When I'm still, nothing around me follows a natural course of conduct. I'm not saying I'm any criterion, I wouldn't say that. After all, when I'm on the train I'm not really moving at all. That's obvious. I'm in the corner seat.
I'm still. I am perhaps being moved, but I do not move. Neither do the yellow lights. The train moves, granted, but what's a train got to do with it?
MARK: Nothing.
LEN: You're frightened.
MARK: Am I?
LEN: You're frightened that any moment I'm liable to put a red hot burning coal in your mouth.
MARK: Am I?
LEN: But when the time comes, you see, what I shall do is place the red hot burning coal in my own mouth.
Swift blackout. PETE sits where MARK has been. Lights snap up.
I've got some beigels.
PETE: This is a very solid table, isn't it?
LEN: I said I've got some biegels.
PETE: No thanks. How long have you had this table?
LEN: It's a family heirloom.
PETE: Yes, I'd like a good table, and a good chair. Solid stuff.
Made for the bearer. I'd put them in a boat. Sail it down the river. A houseboat. You could sit in the cabin and look out at the water.
LEN: Who'd be steering?
PETE: You could park it. Park it. There's not a soul in sight.
LEN brings half-full bottle of wine and glass to table. Reads label. Sniffs at bottle. Pours some into glass, savours then gargles, walking about. Spits wine back into glass, returns bottle and glass at sideboard, after a defensive glance at PETE.
Returns to above table.
LEN (muttering]: Impossible, impossible, impossible.
PETE [briskly]: I've been thinking about you.
LEN: Oh?
PETE: Do you know what your trouble is? You're not elastic.
There's no elasticity in you. You want to be more elastic.
LEN: Elastic? Elastic. Yes, you're quite right. Elastic. What are you talking about?
PETE: Giving up the ghost isn't so much a failure as a tactical error. By elastic I mean being prepared for your own deviations. You don't know where you're going to come out next at the moment. You're like a rotten old shirt. Buck your ideas up. They'll lock you up before you're much older.
LEN: No. There is a different sky each time I look. The clouds run about in my eye. I can't do it.
PETE: The apprehension of experience must obviously be dependent upon discrimination if it's to be considered valuable. That's what you lack. You've got no idea how to preserve a distance between what you smell and what you think about it. You haven't got the faculty for making a simple distinction between one thing and another. Every time you walk out of this door you go straight over a cliff. What you've got to do is nourish the power of assess-ment. How can you hope to assess and verify anything if you walk about with your nose stuck between your feet all day long? You knock around with Mark too much. He can't do you any good. I know how to handle him. But I don't think he's your sort. Between you and me, I sometimes think he's a man of weeds. Sometimes I think he's just playing a game. But what game? I like him all right when you come down to it. We're old pals. But you look at him and what do you see? An attitude. Has it substance or is it barren? Sometimes I think it's as barren as a bombed site. He'll be a spent force in no time if he doesn't watch his step. [Pause.] I'll tell you a dream I had last night. I was with a girl in a tube station, on the platform. People were rushing about. There was some sort of panic. When I looked round I saw everyone's faces were peeling, blotched, blistered. People were screaming, booming down the tun-nels. There was a fire bell clanging. When I looked at the girl I saw that her face was coming off in slabs too, like plaster. Black scabs and stains. The skin was dropping off like lumps of cat's meat. I could hear it sizzling on the electric rails. I pulled her by the arm to get her out of there.
She wouldn't budge. Stood there, with half a face, staring at me. I screamed at her to come away. Then I thought, Christ, what's my face like? Is that why she's staring? Is that rotting too?
Lights change. LEN's room. PETE and MARK looking at chess board. LEN watching them. Silence.
LEN: Eh...
(They don't look up.]
The dwarfs are back on the job. [Pause.] I said the dwarfs are back on the job.
MARK: The what?
LEN: The dwarfs.
MARK: On yes?
LEN: Oh yes. They've been waiting for a smoke signal you see. I've just sent up the smoke signal.
[Pause.]
MARK: You've just sent it up, have you?
LEN: Yes. I've called them in on the job. They've taken up their positions. Haven't you noticed?
PETE: I haven't noticed. [To MARK.] Have you noticed?
MARK chuckles.
LEN: But I'll tell you one thing. They don't stop work until the job in hand is finished, one way or another. They never run out on a job. Oh no. They're true professionals. Real professionals.
PETE: Listen. Can't you see we're trying to play chess?
Pause.
LEN: I've called them in to keep an eye on you two, you see.
They're going to keep a very close eye on you. So am I.
We're waiting for you to show your hand. We're all going to keep a very close eye on you two. Me and the dwarfs.
Pause.
MARR: [referring to chess: I think I've got you knackered, Pete.
PETE looks at him.
PETE: Do you?
Lights change and come up full in MARK's room. LEN enters with old gilt mirror. MARK follows.
MARK: Put that mirror back.
LEN: This is the best piece of furniture you've got in the house.
It's Spanish. No Portuguese. You're Portuguese, aren't you?
MARR: Put it back.
LEN: Look at your face in this mirror. Look. It's a farce. Where are your features? You haven't got any features. You couldn't call those features. What are you going to do about it, eh? What's the answer?
MARR: Mind that mirror. It's not insured.
LEN: I saw Pete the other day. In the evening. You didn't know that. I wonder about you. I often wonder about you. But I must keep pedalling. I must. There's a time limit.
Who have you got hiding here? You're not alone here. What about your Esperanto? Don't forget, anything over two ounces goes up a penny.
MARK: Thanks for the tip.
LEN: Here's your mirror.
MARK exits with mirror. LEN picks out apple from a fruit bowl, sits in armchair staring at it. MARK returns.
This is a funny-looking apple.
[He tosses it back to MARK, who replaces it.]
Pete asked me to lend him a shilling.
MARK: Uh?
LEN: I refused.
MARK: What?
LEN: I refused downright to lend him a shilling.
MARK: What did he say to that?
LEN: Plenty. Since I left him I've been thinking thoughts I've never thought before. I've been thinking thoughts I've never thought before.
MARK: You spend too much time with Pete.
LEN: What?
MARK: Give it a rest. He doesn't do you any good. I'm the only one who knows how to get on with him. I can handle him. You can't. You take him too seriously. He doesn't worry me. I know how to handle him. He doesn't take any liberties with me.
LEN: Who says he takes liberties with me? Nobody takes liberties with me. I'm not the sort of man you can take liberties with.
MARK: You should drop it.
LEN sees toasting fork, takes it to MARK.
LEN: This is a funny toasting fork. Do you ever make any toast? He drops the fork on the floor. Don't touch it! You don't know what will happen if you touch it! You mustn't touch it! You mustn't bend! Wait.
[Pause.] I'll bend. I'll… pick it up. I'm going to touch it.
[Pause ... softly.] There. You see? Nothing happens when I touch it. Nothing. Nothing can happen. No one would bother. [A broken sigh.] You see, I can't see the broken glass.
I can't see the mirror I have to look through. I see the other side. The other side. But I can't see the mirror side.
[Pause.] I want to break it, all of it. But how can I break it?
How can I break it when I can't see it?
Lights fade and come up again in MARK's room. LEN is sitting in an arm chair. MARK enters with whisky bottle and two glasses. He pours drinks for PETE and himself. PETE, who has followed him in, takes his glass. MARK sits in other armchair.
Neither take any notice of LEN.
Silence.
PETE: Thinking got me into this and thinking's got to get me out. You know what I want? An efficient idea. You know what I mean? An efficient idea. One that'll work. Something I can pin my money on. An each way bet. Nothing's guaranteed, I know that. But I'm willing to gamble. I gambled when I went to work in the city. I want to fight them on their own ground, not moan about them from a distance. I did it and I'm still living. But I've had my fill of these city guttersnipes—all that scavenging scum! They're the sort of people, who, if the gates of heaven opened to them, all they'd feel would be a draught. I'm wasting away down there. The time has come to act. I'm after something truly workable, something deserving of the proper and active and voluntary application of my own powers. And I'll find it.
LEN: I squashed a tiny insect on a plate the other day. And I brushed the remains off my finger with my thumb. Then I saw that the fragments were growing, like fluff. As they were falling, they were becoming larger, like fluff. I had put my hand into the body of a dead bird.
PETE: The trouble is, you've got to be quite sure of what you mean by efficient. Look at a nutcracker. You press the cracker and the cracker cracks the nut. You might think that's an exact process. It's not. The nut cracks, but the hinge of the cracker gives out a friction which is completely incidental to the particular idea. It's unnecessary, an escape and wastage of energy to no purpose. So there's nothing efficient about a nutcracker. [Pete sits, drinks].
LEN: They've gone on a picnic.
MARK: Who?
LEN: The dwarfs.
PETE: Oh Christ. [Picks up paper.]
LEN: They've left me to sweep the yard, to keep the place in order. It's a bloody liberty. They're supposed to be keeping you under observation. What do they think I am, a bloody charlady? I can't look after the place by myself, it's not possible. Piles and piles and piles of muck and leavings all over the place, spewed up spewed up, I'm not a skivvy, they don't pay me, I pay them.
MARK: Why don't you settle down?
LEN: Oh don't worry, it's basically a happy relationship. I trust them. They're very efficient. They know what they'se waiting for. But they've got a new game, did I tell you? It's to do with beetles and twigs. There's a rockery of red-hot cinder. I like watching them. Their hairs are curled and oily on their necks. Always squatting and bending, dipping their wicks in the custard. Now and again a lick of flame screws up their noses. Do you know what they do?
They run wild. They yowl, they pinch, they dribble, they whimper, they gouge, and then they soothe each others' orifices with a local ointment, and then, all gone, all for-gotten, they lark about, each with his buddy, get out the nose spray and the scented syringe, settle down for the night with a bun and a doughnut.
PETE: See you Mark. [Exit.]
MARK: Why don't you put it on the table? [Pause.] Open it up, Len. [Pause.) I'm supposed to be a friend of yours.
LEN: You're a snake in my house.
MARK: Really?
LEN: You're trying to buy and sell me. You think I'm a ventriloquist's dummy. You've got me pinned to the wall before I open my mouth. You've got a tab on me, you're buying me out of house and home, you're a calculating bastard. [Pause.] Answer me. Say something. [Pause.] Do you understand? [Pause.] You don't agree? [Pause.] You disagree? [Pause.] You think I'm mistaken? [Pause.] But am I? [Pause.] Both of you bastards, you've made a hole in my side, I can't plug it! [Pause.] I've lost a kingdom. I suppose you're taking good care of things. Did you know that you and Pete are a music hall act? What happens? What do you do when you're alone? Do you do a jig? I suppose you're taking good care of things. I've got my treasure too. It's in my corner. Everything's in my corner. Everything is from the corner's point of view. I don't hold the whip. I'm a labouring man. I do the corner's will. I slave my guts out. I thought, at one time, that I'd escaped it, but it never dies, it's never dead. I feed it, it's well fed. Things that at one time seem to me of value I have no resource but to give it to eat and what was of value turns into pus. I can hide nothing. I can't lay anything aside. Nothing can be put aside, nothing can be hidden, nothing can be saved, it waits, it eats, it's voracious, you're in it, Pete's in it, you're all in my corner. There must be somewhere else!
Swift cross fade of lights to down centre area.
PETE is seen vaguely, standing downstage below LEN'S room.
MARK is seated in his room. Unlit. LEN crouches, watching PETE.
Pete walks by the river. Under the woodyard wall stops.
Stops. Hiss of the yellow grass. The wood battlements jaw over the wall. Dust in the fairground ticks. The night ticks. He hears the tick of the roundabout, up river with the sweat.
Pete walks by the river. Under the woodyard wall stops. Stops. The wood hangs. Deathmask on the water. Pete walks by the — gull. Slicing gull. Gull. Down. He stops. Rat corpse in the yellow grass. Gull pads. Gull probes. Gull stamps his feet. Gull whinnies up. Gull screams, tears, Pete, tears, digs, Pete cuts, breaks, Pete stretches the corpse, flaps his wings, Pete's beak grows, probes, digs, pulls, the river jolts, no moon, what can I see, the dwarfs collect, they slide down the bridge, they scutter by the shoreside, the dwarfs collect, capable, industrious, they wear raincoats, it is going to rain, Pete digs, he screws in to the head, the dwarfs watch, Pete tugs, he tugs, he's tugging, he kills, he's killing, the rat's head, with a snap the cloth of the rat's head tears. Pete walks by the ... [Deep groan.] He sinks into chair left of his table. Lights in LEN's room swiftly fade up. PETE turns to him.
PETE: You look the worse for wear. What's the matter with you?
LEN: I've been ill.
PETE: I’ll? What's the matter?
LEN: Cheese. Stale cheese. It got me in the end. I've been
eating a lot of cheese.
PETE: Yes, well, it's easy to eat too much cheese.
LEN: It all came out, in about twenty-eight goes. I couldn't stop shivering and I couldn't stop squatting. It got me all right. I'm all right now. I only go three times a day now. I can more or less regulate it. Once in the morning. A quick dash before lunch. Another quick dash after tea, and then I'm free to do what I want. I don't think you under-stand. That cheese didn't die. It only began to live when you swallowed it, you see, after it had gone down. I bumped into a German one night, he came home with me and helped me finish it off. He took it to bed with him, he sat up in bed with it, in the guest's suite. I went in and had a gander. He had it taped. He was brutal with it. He would bite into it and then concentrate. I had to hand it to him. The sweat came out on his nose but he stayed on his feet. After he'd got out of bed, that was. Stood bolt upright, swallowed it, clicked his fingers, ordered another piece of blackcurrant pie. It's my pie-making season. His piss stank worse than the cheese.
You look in the pink.
PETE: You want to watch your step. You know that? You're going from bad to worse. Why don't you pull yourself together? Eh? Get a steady job. Cultivate a bit of go and guts for a change. Make yourself useful, mate, for Christ's sake. As you are, you're just a dead weight round everybody's neck. You want to listen to your friends, mate. Who else have you got?
PETE taps him on the shoulder and exits. A light comes up on MARK. The lights in LEN's room fade out. LEN rises to down centre.
LEN: Mark sits by the fireside. Crosses his legs. His fingers wear a ring. The finger poised. Mark regards his finger. He regards his legs. He regards the fireside. Outside the door is the black blossom. He combs his hair with an ebony comb, he sits, he lies, he lowers his eyelashes, raises them, sees no change in the posture of the room, lights a cigarette, watches his hand clasp the lighter, watches the flame, sees his mouth go forward, sees the consummation, is satisfied. Pleased, sees the smoke in the lamp, pleased with the lamp and the smoke and his bulk, pleased with his legs and his ring and his hand and his body in the lamp. Sees himself speaking, the words arranged on his lips, sees himself with pleasure silent. 
Under the twigs they slide, by the lilac bush, break the stems, sit, scutter to the edge of the lawn and there wait, capable, industrious, put up their sunshades, watch. Mark lies, heavy, content, watches his smoke in the window, times his puff out, his hand fall, [with growing disgust) smiles at absent guests, sucks in all comers, arranges his web, lies there a spider.
LEN moves to above armchair in MARK'S room as lights fade up. Down centre area fades out.
What did you say?
MARK: I never said anything.
LEN: What do you do when you're tired, go to bed?
MARK: That's right.
LEN: You sleep like a log.
MARK: Yes.
LEN: What do you do when you wake up?
MARK: Wake up.
LEN: I want to ask you a question.
MARK: No doubt.
LEN: Are you prepared to answer questions?
MARK: No.
LEN: What do you do in the day when you're not walking about?
MARK: I rest.
LEN: Where do you find a resting place?
MARK: Here and there.
LEN: By consent?
MARK: Invariably.
LEN: But you're not particular?
MARK: Yes, I'm particular.
LEN: You choose your resting place?
MARK: Normally.
LEN: That might be anywhere?
MARK: Yes.
LEN: Does that content you?
MARR: Sure! I've got a home. I know where I live.
LEN: You mean you've got roots. Why haven't I got roots?
My house is older than yours. My family lived here. Why haven't I got a home?
MARK: Move out.
LEN: Do you believe in God?
MARK: What?
LEN: Do you believe in God?
MARK: Who?
LEN: God.
MARK: God?
LEN: Do you believe in God?
MARK: Do I believe in God?
LEN: Yes.
MARK: Would you say that again?
LEN goes swiftly to shelf. Picks up biscuit jar. Offers to MARK.
LEN: Have a biscuit.
MARK: Thanks.
LEN: They're your biscuits.
MARK: There's two left. Have one yourself.
LEN puts biscuits away.
LEN: You don't understand. You'll never understand.
MARK: Really?
LEN: Do you know what the point is? Do you know what it is?
MARK: No.
LEN: The point is, who are you? Not why or how, not even what. I can see what, perhaps, clearly enough. But who are you? It's no use saying you know who you are just because you tell me you can fit your particular key into a particular slot, which will only receive your particular key because that's not foolproof and certainly not conclusive. Just because you're inclined to make these statements of faith has nothing to do with me. It's not my business. Occasionally I believe I perceive a little of what you are but tha's pure accident. Pure accident on both our parts, the perceived and the perceiver. It's nothing like an accident, it's deliberate, it's a joint pretence. We depend on these accidents, on these contrived accidents, to continue. It's not important then that it's conspiracy or hallucination.
What you are, or appear to be to me, or appear to be to you, changes so quickly, so horrifyingly, I certainly can't keep up with it and I'm damn sure you can't either. But who you are I can't even begin to recognize, and sometimes I recognize it so wholly, so forcibly, I can't look, and how can I be certain of what I see? You have no number. Where am I to look, where am I to look, what is there to locate, so as to have some surety, to have some rest from this whole bloody racket? You're the sum of so many reflections. How many reflections? Whose reflections? Is that what you consist of? What scum does the tide leave? What happens to the scum? When does it happen? I've seen what happens. But I can't speak when I see it. I can only point a finger. I can't even do that. The scum is broken and sucked back. I don't see where it goes. I don't see when, what do I see, what have I seen? What have I seen, the scum or the essence? What about it? Does all this give you the right to stand there and tell me you know who you are? It's a bloody impertinence. There's a great desert and there's a wind stopping. Pete's been eating too much cheese, he's ill from it, it's eating his flesh away, but that doesn't matter, you're still both in the same boat, you're eating all my biscuits, but that doesn't matter, you're still both in the same boat, you're still standing behind the curtains together. He thinks you're a fool, Pete thinks you're a fool, but that doesn't matter, you're still both of you standing behind my curtains, moving my curtains in my room. He may be your Black Knight, you may be his Black Knight, but I'm cursed with the two of you, with two Black Knight's, that's friendship, that's this that I know. That's what I know.
MARK: Pete thinks I'm a fool? [Pause.] Pete... Pete thinks that I'm a fool?
LEN exits. Lights in MARK's room fade out and then fade in again. Doorbell rings. MARK rises, goes off to front door.
Silence.
PETE [entering]: Hullo, Mark.
MARK [re-enters and sits again]: Hullo.
PETE: What are you doing?
MARK: Nothing.
PETE: Can I sit down?
MARK: Sure.
Pete sits right armchair. Pause.
PETE: Well, what are you doing with yourself?
MARK: When's that?
PETE: Now.
MARK: Nothing.
MARK files his nails.
[Pause.]
PETE: Len's in hospital.
MARK: Len? What's the matter with him?
PETE: Kidney trouble. Not serious. [Pause.) Well, what have you been doing with yourself?
MARK: When?
PETE: Since I saw you.
MARK: This and that.
PETE: This and what?
MARK: That.
[Pause.]
PETE: Do you want to go and see Len?
MARK: When? Now?
PETE: Yes. It's visiting time. [Pause.] Are you busy?
MARK: No.
[Pause.]
PETE: What's up?
MARK: What?
PETE: What's up?
MARK: What do you mean?
PETE: You're wearing a gasmask.
MARK: Not me.
[Pause.]
PETE [rising]: Ready?
MARK: Yes. [He rises and exits.]
PETE [as he follows MARK off]: Fine day. [Pause.] Bit chilly.
The door slams as they leave the house. Lights up on LEN in hospital bed. Listening to wireless (earphones).
PETE and MARK enter.
LEN: You got here.
PETE [sitting left of bed]: Yes.
LEN: They can't do enough for me here.
PETE: Why's that?
LEN: Because I'm no trouble. [MARK sits right of bed.] They treat me like a king. These nurses, they treat me exactly like a king. [Pause.] Mark looks as though he's caught a crab.
MARK: Do I?
PETE: Airy, this ward.
LEN: Best quality blankets, home cooking, everything you could wish for. Look at the ceiling. It's not too high and it's not too low.
[Pause.]
PETE: By the way, Mark, what happened to your pipe?
MARK: Nothing happened to it.
[Pause.]
LEN: You smoking a pipe? [Pause.] What's it like out today?
PETE: Bit chilly.
LEN: Bound to be.
PETE: The sun's come out.
LEN: The sun's come out? [Pause.] Well, Mark, bring off the treble chance this week?
MARK: Not me.
[Pause.]
LEN: Who's driving the tank?
PETE: What?
LEN: Who's driving the tank?
PETE: Don't ask me. We've been walking up the road back to back.
LEN: You've what? [Pause.] You've been walking up the road back to back? [Pause.] What are you doing sitting on my bed? You're not supposed to sit on the bed, you're supposed to sit on the chairs!
PETE [rising and moving off]: Well, give me a call when you get out. [He exits.]
MARK [rising and following him]: Yes give me a call. [He exits.]
LEN: [calling after them]: How do I know you'll be in?
Blackout. Lights come up on MARK's flat. MARK enters and sits. PETE enters, glances at MARK, sits.
PETE: Horizontal personalities, those places. You're the only vertical. Makes you feel dizzy. [Pause.] You ever been inside one of those places?
MARK: I can't remember.
PETE: Right. [Stubs out cigarette, rises, goes to exit.]
MARK: All right. Why do you knock on my door?
PETE: What?
MARK: Come on. Why do you knock on my door?
PETE: What are you talking about?
MARK: Why?
PETE: I call to see you.
MARK: What do you want with me? Why come and see me?
PETE: Why?
MARK: You're playing a double game. You've been playing a double game. You've been using me. You've been leading me up the garden.
PETE: Mind how you go.
MARK: You've been wasting my time. For years.
PETE: Don't push me boy.
MARK: You think I'm a fool.
PETE: Is that what I think?
MARK: That's what you think. You think I'm a fool.
PETE: You are a fool.
MARK: You've always thought that.
PETE: From the beginning.
MARK: You've been leading me up the garden.
PETE: And you.
MARK: You know what you are? You're an infection.
PETE: Don't believe it. All I've got to do to destroy you is to leave you as you wish to be.
He walks out of the room. MARK stares, slowly goes off as lights fade. Lights come up on down centre area. Enter LEN.
LEN: They've stopped eating. It'll be a quick get out when the whistle blows. All their belongings are stacked in piles.
They've doused the fire. But I've heard nothing. What is the cause for alarm? Why is everything packed? Why are they ready for the off? But they say nothing. They've cut me off without a penny. And now they've settled down to a wide-eyed kip, crosslegged by the fire. It's insupportable. I'm left in the lurch. Not even a stale frankfurter, a slice of bacon rind, a leaf of cabbage, not even a mouldy piece of salami, like they used to sling me in the days when we told old tales by suntime. They sit, chock-full. But I smell a rat. They seem to be anticipating a rarer dish, a choicer spread. And this change. All about me the change. The yard as I know it is littered with scraps of cat's meat, pig bollocks, tin cans, bird brains, spare parts of all the little animals, a squelching, squealing carpet, all the dwarfs' leavings spittled in the muck, worms stuck in the poisoned shit heaps, the alleys a whirlpool of piss, slime, blood, and fruit juice. Now all is bare. All is clean. All is scrubbed. There is a lawn. There is a shrub. There is a flower.
The telephone box is lit in a half light. A figure can be dimly observed inside it, with his back to the audience. The rest of the stage is dark. In the house the telephone is ringing. It is late at night.
Night light in house fades up. Street fades up.
HARRY approaches the house, opens the front door and goes in.
He switches on a light in the hall, goes into the living-room, walks to the telephone and lifts it.
HARRY. Hullo.
VOICE. Is that you, Bill ?
HARRY. No, he's in bed. Who's this?
VOICE. In bed?
HARRY. Who is this ?
VOICE. What's he doing in bed?
Pause.
HARRY. Do you know it's four o'clock in the morning?
VOICE. Well, give him a nudge. Tell him I want a word with him. (Pause.)
HARRY. Who is this ?
VOICE. Go and wake him up, there's a good boy. (Pause.)
HARRY. Are you a friend of his?
VOICE. He'll know me when he sees me.
HARRY. Oh yes?
Pause.
VOICE. Aren't you going to wake him?
HARRY. No, I'm not.
Pause.
VOICE. Tell him I'll be in touch.
The telephone cuts off. HARRY replaces the receiver and stands still. The figure leaves the telephone box. HARRY walks slowly into the hall and up the stairs.
Fade to blackout.
Fade up on flat. It is morning.
JAMES, smoking, enters and sits on the sofa.
STELLA enters from a bedroom fixing a bracelet on her wrist.
She goes to the cabinet, takes a perfume atomizer from her handbag and uses it on her throat and hands. She puts the atomizer into her bag and begins to put her gloves on.
STELLA. I'm going.
Pause.
Aren't you coming in today?
Pause.
JAMES. No.
STELLA. You had to meet those people from...
Pause. She slowly walks to an armchair, picks up her jacker and puts it on.
You had to meet those people about that order. Shall I phone them when I get to the shop?
JAMES. You could do… yes.
STELLA. What are you going to do?
He looks at her, with a brief smile, then away.
Jimmy… 
Pause.
Are you going out ?
Pause.
Will you ... be in tonight?
JAMES reaches for a glass ashtray, flicks ash, and regards the ashtray. STELLA turns and leaves the room. The front door slams. JAMES continues regarding the ashtray.
Fade to half light.
Fade up on house. Morning.
BILL brings on a tray from the kitchen and places it on the table, arranges it, pours tea, sits, picks up a newspaper, reads, drinks. HARRY, in a dressing-gown, descends the stairs, trips,
stumbles.
BILL (turning). What have you done ?
HARRY. I tripped on that stair rod!
He comes into the room.
BILL. All right.
HARRY. It's that stair rod. I thought you said you were going to fix it.
BILL. I did fix it.
HARRY. Well, you didn't fix it very well.
He sits, holding his head.
Ooh.
BILL pours tea for him.
In the flat, JAMES stubs his cigarette and goes out. The lights in the flat fade out.
HARRY sips the tea, then puts the cup down.
Where's my fruit juice? I haven't had my fruit juice.
BILL regards the fruit juice on the tray.
What's it doing over there?
BILL gives it to him. HARRY sips it.
What's this? Pineapple?
BILL. Grapefruit.
Pause.
HARRY. I'm sick and tired of that stair rod. Why don't you screw it in or something? You're supposed... you're supposed to be able to use your hands.
Pause.
BILL. What time did you get in?
HARRY. Four.
BILL. Good party?
Pause.
HARRY. You didn't make any toast this morning
BILL. No. Do you want some?
HARRY. No. I don't.
BILL. I can if you like.
HARRY. It's all right. Don't bother.
Pause.
How are you spending your day today?
BILL. Go and see a film, I think.
HARRY. Wonderful life you lead. (Pause.) Do you know some maniac telephoned you last night?
BILL looks at him.
Just as I got in. Four o'clock. Walked in the door and the telephone was ringing.
BILL. Who was it?
HARRY. I've no idea.
BILL. What did he want?
HARRY. You. He was shy, wouldn't tell me his name.
BILL. Huh.
Pause.
HARRY. Who could it have been?
BILL. I've no idea.
HARRY. He was very insistent. Said he was going to get in touch again. (Pause.) Who the hell was it?
BILL. I've just said... I haven't the remotest idea.
Pause.
HARRY. Did you meet anyone last week?
BILL. Meet anyone? What do you mean?
HARRY. I mean could it have been anyone you met? You must have met lots of people.
BILL. I didn't speak to a soul.
HARRY. Must have been miserable for you.
BILL. I was only there one night, wasn't I? Some more?
HARRY. No, thank you.
BILL pours tea for himself.
The telephone box fades up to half light, disclosing a figure entering it.
I must shave.
HARRY SiS, looking at BILL, who is reading the paper After a moment BILL looks up.
BILL. Mmnnn?
Silence. HAKRY stands, leaves the room and exits up the stairs, treading carefully over the stair rod. BILL reads the paper. The telephone rings.
BILL lifts the receiver.
Hullo.
VOICE. Is that you, Bill ?
BILL. Yes?
VOICE. Are you in?
BILL. Who's this ?
VOICE. Don't move. I'll be straight round.
BILL. What do you mean? Who is this?
VOICE. About two minutes. All right?
BILL. You can't do that. I've got some people here.
VOICE. Never mind. We can go into another room.
BILL. This is ridiculous. Do I know you?
VOICE. You'll know me when you see me.
BILL. Do you know me?
VOICE. Just stay where you are. I'll be right round.
BILL. But what do you want, who - ? You can't do that. I'm going straight out. I won't be in.
VOICE. See you.
The phone cuts off. BILL replaces the receiver.
The lights on the telephone box fade as the figure comes out and exits left.
BILL puts on his jacket, goes into the hall, puts on his over-coat, swift but not hurried, opens the front door, and goes out.
He exits up right. HARRY's voice from upstairs.
HARRY. Bill, was that you?
He appears at the head of the stairs.
Bill!
He goes downstairs, into the living-room, stands, observes the tray, and takes the tray into the kitchen.
JAMES comes from up left in the street and looks at the house.
HARRY comes out of the kitchen, goes into the hall and up the stairs.
JAMES rings the bell.
HARRY comes down the stairs and opens the door.
Yes?
JAMES. I'm looking for Bill Lloyd.
HARRY. He's out. Can I help?
JAMES. When will he be in ?
HARRY. I can't say. Does he know you?
JAMES. I'll try some other time then.
HARRY. Well, perhaps you'd like to leave your name. I can tell him when I see him.
JAMES. No, that's all right. Just tell him I called.
HARRY. Tell him who called ?
JAMES. Sorry to bother you.
HARRY. Just a minute. (JAMES turns back.) You're not the man who telephoned last night, are you?
JAMES. Last night?
HARRY. You didn't telephone early this morning?
JAMES. No ... sorry ...
HARRY. Well, what do you want?
JAMES. I'm looking for Bill.
HARRY. You didn't by any chance telephone just now?
JAMES. I think you've got the wrong man.
HARRY. I think you have.
JAMES. I don't think you know anything about it.
JAMES turns and goes. HARRY stands watching him.
Fade to blackout.
Fade up moonlight in flat.
The front door closes, in flat.
STELLA comes in, stands, switches on a lamp. She turns in the direction of the other rooms.
STELLA. Jimmy?
Silence.
She takes her gloves off, puts her handbag down, and is still.
She goes to the record player, and puts on a record. It is
'Charlie Parker'. She listens, then exists to the bedroom.
Fade up house. Night.
BILL enters the living-room from the kitchen with magazines.
He throws them in the hearth, goes to the drinks table and pours a drink, then lies on the floor with a drink by the hearth, flicking through a magazine. STELLA comes back into the room with a white Persian kitten. She lies back on the sofa, nuzzling it. HARRY comes downstairs, glances in at BILL, exits and walks down the street to up right. JAMES appears at the front door of the house from up left, looks after HARRY, and rings the bell. BILL stands, and goes to the Fade flat to half light and music our.
BILL. Yes?
JAMES. Bill Lloyd?
BILL. Yes?
JAMES. Oh, I'd ... I'd like to have a word with you,
Pause.
BILL. I'm sorry, I don't think I know you?
JAMES. Don't you?
BILL. No.
JAMES. Well, there's something I'd like to talk to you about BILL. I'm terribly sorry, I'm busy.
JAMES. It won't take long.
BILL. I'm awfully sorry. Perhaps you'd like to put it down on paper and send it to me.
JAMES. That's not possible.
Pause.
BILL (closing door). Do forgive me -
JAMES (foot in door). Look. I want to speak to you.
Pause.
BILL. Did you phone me today?
JAMES. That's right. I called, but you'd gone out.
BILL. You called here? I didn't know that.
JAMES. I think I'd better come in, don't you?
BILL. You can't just barge into someone's house like this, you know. What do you want?
JAMES. Why don't you stop wasting your time and let me in?
BILL. I could call the police.
JAMES. Not worth it.
They stare at each other.
BILL. All right.
JAMES goes in. BILL closes the door. JAMES goes through the hall and into the living-room. BILl follows. JAMES looks about the room.
JAMES. Got any olives?
BILL. How did you know my name?
JAMES. No olives?
BILL. Olives? I'm afraid not.
JAMES. You mean to say you don't keep olives for your guests?
BILL. You're not my guest, you're an intruder. What can 1 do for you?
JAMES. Do you mind if I sit down?
BILL. Yes, I do.
JAMES. You'll get over it.
JAMES sits. BILL stands. JAMES stands, takes off his over-coaz, throws it on an armchair, and sits again.
BILL. What's your name, old boy?
JAMES reaches to a bowl of fruit and breaks off a grape, which he eats.
JAMES. Where shall I put the pips?
BILL. In your wallet.
JAMES takes our his waller and deposits the pips. He regards BILL.
JAMES. You're not a bad-looking bloke.
BILL. Oh, thanks.
JAMES. You're not a film star, but you're quite tolerable looking, I suppose.
BILL. That's more than I can say for you.
JAMES. I'm not interested in what you can say for me.
BILL. To put it quite bluntly, old chap, I'm even less interested than you are. Now look, come on please, what do you want ?
JAMES stands, walks to the drinks table and stares at the bottles. In the flat, STELLA rises with the kitten and goes off slowly, nuzzling it. The flat fades to blackout. JAMES fours himself a whisky.
Cheers.
JAMES. Did you have a good time in Leeds last week i BILL. What ?
JAMES. Did you have a good time in Leeds last week?
BILL. Leeds?
JAMES. Did you enjoy yourself?
BILL. What makes you think I was in Leeds.
JAMES. Tell me all about it. See much of the town? Get out
to the country at all ?
BILL. What are you talking about?
Pause.
JAMES (with fatigue). Aaah. You were down there for the dress collection. You took some of your models.
BILL. Did I?
JAMES. You stayed at the Westbury Hotel.
BILL. Oh?
JAMES. Room 142.
BILL. 142? Oh. Was it comfortable?
JAMES. Comfortable enough.
BILL. Oh, good.
JAMES. Well, you had your yellow pyjamas with you.
BILL. Did I really? What, the ones with the black initials?
JAMES. Yes, you had them on you in 165.
BILL. In what?
JAMES. 165.
BILL. 165? I thought I was in 142.
JAMES. You booked into 142. But you didn't stay there.
BILL. Well, that's a bit silly, isn't it? Booking a room and not staying in it?
JAMES. I65 is just along the passage to 142; you're not far away.
BILL. Oh well, that's a relief.
JAMES. You could easily nip back to shave.
BILL. From 165?
JAMES. Yes.
BILL. What was I doing there?
JAMES (casually). My wife was in there. That's where you slept with her.
Silence.
BILL. Well... who told you that?
JAMES. She did.
BILL. You should have her seen to.
JAMES. Be careful.
BILL. Mmmm? Who is your wife?
JAMES. You know her.
BILL. I don't think so.
JAMES. No?
BILL. No, I don't think so at all.
JAMES. I see.
BILL. I was nowhere near Leeds last week, old chap. Nowhere near your wife either, I'm quite sure of that. Apart from that, I... just don't do such things. Not in my book.
Pause.
I wouldn't dream of it. Well, I think that closes that subject, don't you?
JAMES. Come here. I want to tell you something.
BILL. I'm expecting guests in a minute, you know. Cocktails, I'm standing for Parliament next season.
JAMES. Come here.
BILL. I'm going to be Minister for Home Affairs.
JAMES moves to him.
JAMES (confidentially). When you treat my wife like a whore, then I think I'm entitled to know what you've got to say about it.
BILL. But I don't know your wife.
JAMES. You do. You met her at ten o'clock last Friday in the lounge. You fell into conversation, you bought her a couple of drinks, you went upstairs together in the lift. In the lift you never took your eyes from her, you found you were both on the same floor, you helped her out, by her arm. You stood with her in the corridor, looking at her. You touched her shoulder, said good night, went to your room, she went to hers, you changed into your yellow pyjamas and black dressing-gown, you went down the passage and knocked on her door, you'd left your toothpaste in town. She opened the door, you went in, she was still dressed. You admired the room, it was so feminine, you felt awake, didn't feel like sleeping, you sat down, on the bed. She wanted you to go, you wouldn't. She became upset, you sympathized, away from home, on a business trip, horrible life, especially for a woman, you comforted her, you gave her solace, you stayed.
Pause.
BILL. Look, do you mind... just going off now. You're giving me a bit of a headache.
JAMES. You knew she was married... why did you feel it necessary ... to do that?
BILL. She must have known she was married, too. Why did she feel it necessary ... to do that?
Pause.
(With a chuckle.) That's got you, hasn't it?
Pause.
Well, look, it's really just a lot of rubbish. You know that.
BILL goes to the cigarette box and lights a cigarette.
Is she supposed to have resisted me at all ?
JAMES. A little.
BILL. Only a little?
JAMES. Yes.
BILL. Do you believe her?
JAMES. Yes.
BILL. Everything she says?
JAMES. Sure.
BILL. Did she bite at all ?
JAMES. No.
BILL. Scratch?
JAMES. A little.
BILL. You've got a devoted wife, haven't you? Keeps you well informed, right up to the minutest detail. She scratched a little, did she? Where? (Holds up a hand.) On the hand?
No scar. No scar anywhere. Absolutely unscarred. We can go before a commissioner of oaths, if you like. I'll strip, show you my unscarred body. Yes, what we need is an independent witness. You got any chambermaids on your side or anything?
JAMES applauds briefly.
JAMES. You're a wag, aren't you? I never thought you'd be such a wag. You've really got a sense of fun. You know what I'd call you?
BILL. What?
JAMES. A wag.
BILL. Oh, thanks very much.
JAMES. No, I'm glad to pay a compliment when a compliment's due. What about a drink?
BILL. That's good of you.
JAMES. What will you have?
BILL. Got any vodka?
JAMES. Let's see. Yes, I think we can find you some vodka.
BILL. Oh, scrumptious.
JAMES. Say that again.
BILL. What?
JAMES. That word.
BILL. What, scrumptious?
JAMES. That's it.
BILL. Scrumptious.
JAMES. Marvellous. You probably remember that from school, don't you ?
BILL. Now that you mention it I think you might be right.
JAMES. I thought I was. Here's your vodka.
BILL. That's very generous of you.
JAMES. Not at all. Cheers. (They drink.)
BILL. Cheers.
JAMES. Eh, come here.
BILL. What?
JAMES. I bet you're a wow at parties.
BILL. Well, it's nice of you to say so, but I wouldn't say I was all that much of a wow.
JAMES. Go on, I bet you are. (Pause.) BILL. You think I'm a wow, do you?
JAMES. At parties I should think you are.
BILL. No, I'm not much of a wow really. The bloke I share this house with is, though.
JAMES. Oh, I met him. Looked a jolly kind of chap.
BILL. Yes, he's very good at parties. Bit of a conjurer.
JAMES. What, rabbits?
BILL. Well, not so much rabbits, no.
JAMES. No rabbits?
BILL. No. He doesn't like rabbits, actually. They give him hay fever.
JAMES. Poor chap.
BILL. Yes, it's a pity.
JAMES. Seen a doctor about it?
BILL. Oh, he's had it since he was that high.
JAMES. Brought up in the country, I suppose?
BILL. In a manner of speaking, yes.
Pause.
Ah well, it's been very nice meeting you, old chap. You must come again when the weather's better.
JAMES makes a sudden move forward. BILL starts back, and falls over a pouffe on to the floor. JAMES chuckles.
Pause.
You've made me spill my drink. You've made me spill it on my cardigan.
JAMES stands over him.
I could easily kick you from here.
Pause.
Are you going to let me get up?
Pause.
Are you going to let me get up?
Pause.
Now listen ... I'll tell you what …
Pause.
If you let me get up ..
Pause.
I'm not very comfortable.
Pause.
If you let me get up ... I'll ... I'll tell you... the truth ...
Pause.
JAMES. Tell me the truth from there.
BILL. No. No, when I'm up.
JAMES. Tell me from there.
Pause.
BILL. Oh well. I'm only telling you because I'm utterly bored ... The truth ... is that it never happened… what you said, anyway. I didn't know she was married. She never told me. Never said a word. But nothing of that... happened, I can assure you. All that happened was… you were right, actually, about going up in the lift... we ... got out of the lift, and then suddenly she was in my arms. Really wasn't my fault, nothing was further from my mind, biggest surprise of my life, must have found me terribly attractive quite suddenly, I don't know ... but I...I didn't refuse. Anyway, we just kissed a bit, only a few minutes, by the lift, no one about, and that was that - she went to her room.
He props himself up on the pouffe.
The rest of it just didn't happen. I mean, I wouldn't do that sort of thing. I mean, that sort of thing ... it's just meaningless. I can understand that you're upset, of course, but honestly, there was nothing else to it. Just a few kisses. (BILL rises, wiping his cardigan.) I'm dreadfully sorry, really, I mean, I've no idea why she should make up all that. Pure fantasy. Really rather naughty of her. Rather alarming.
(Pause.) Do you know her well?
JAMES. And then about midnight you went into her private bathroom and had a bath. You sang 'Coming through the Rye'. You used her bath towel. Then you walked about the room with her bath towel, pretending you were a Roman.
BILL. Did I?
JAMES. Then I phoned.
Pause.
I spoke to her. Asked her how she was. She said she was all right. Her voice was a little low. I asked her to speak up.
She didn't have much to say. You were sitting on the bed, next to her.
Silence.
BILL. Not sitting. Lying.
Blackour.
Church bells.
Full light up on both the flat and the house.
Sunday morning.
JAMES is sitting alone in the living-room of the flat, reading the paper. HARRY and BILL are sitting in the living-room of the house, coffee before them. BILL is reading the paper.
HARRY is watching him.
Silence.
Church bells.
Silence.
HARRY. Put that paper down.
BILL. What?
HARRY. Put it down.
BILL. Why?
HARRY. You've read it.
BILL. No, I haven't. There's lots to read, you know.
HARRY. I told you to put it down.
BILL looks at him, throws the paper at him coolly and rises.
HARRY picks it up and reads.
BILL. Oh, you just wanted it yourself, did you?
HARRY. Want it? I don't want it.
HARRY crumples the paper deliberately and drops it.
I don't want it. Do you want it?
BILL. You're being a little erratic this morning, aren't you?
HARRY. Am I?
BILL. I would say you were.
HARRY. Well, you know what it is, don't you?
BILL. No.
HARRY. It's the church bells. You know how church bells always set me off. You know how they affect me.
BILL. I never hear them.
HARRY. You're not the sort of person who would, are you?
BILL. I'm finding all this faintly idiotic.
BILL bends to pick up the paper.
HARRY. Don't touch that paper.
BILL. Why not?
HARRY. Don't touch it.
BILL stares at him and then slowly picks it up.
Silence.
He tosses it to HARRY.
BILL. You have it. I don't want it.
BILL goes our and up the stairs. HARRY opens the paper and reads it.
In the flat, STELLA comes in with a tray of coffee and biscuits. She places the tray on the coffee-table and passes a cup to JAMES. She sips.
STELLA. Would you like a biscuit?
JAMES. No, thank you.
Pause.
STELLA. I'm going to have one.
JAMES. You'll get fat.
STELLA. From biscuits?
JAMES. You don't want to get fat, do you?
STELLA. Why not?
JAMES. Perhaps you do.
SIBLLA. It's not one of my aims.
JAMES. What is your aim?
Pause.
I'd like an olive.
STELLA. Olive? We haven't got any.
JAMES. How do you know?
STELLA. I know.
JAMES. Have you looked ?
STELLA. I don't need to look, do I? I know what I've got.
JAMES. You know what you've got?
Pause.
Why haven't we got any olives?
STELLA. I didn't know you liked them.
JAMES. That must be the reason why we've never had them in the house. You've simply never been interested enough in olives to ask whether I liked them or not. 
The telephone rings in the house. HARRY puts the paper down and goes to it. BILL comes down the stairs. They stop, facing each other, momentarily. HARRY lifts the receiver.
BILL walks into the room, picks up the paper and sits.
HARRY. Hullo. What? No. Wrong number. (Replaces receiver.)
Wrong number. Who do you think it was?
BILL. I didn't think.
HARRY. Oh, by the way, a chap called for you yesterday.
BILL. Oh yes?
HARRY. Just after you'd gone out.
BILL. Oh yes?
HARRY. Ah well, time for the joint. Roast or chips?
BILL. I don't want any potatoes, thank you.
HARRY. No potatoes? What an extraordinary thing. Yes, this chap, he was asking for you, he wanted you.
BILL. What for?
HARRY. He wanted to know if you ever cleaned your shoes with furniture polish.
BILL. Really? How odd.
HARRY. Not odd. Some kind of national survey.
BILL. What did he look like?
HARRY. Oh... lemon hair, nigger brown teeth, wooden leg, bottlegreen eyes and a toupee. Know him?
BILL. Never met him.
HARRY. You'd know him if you saw him.
BILL. I doubt it.
HARRY. What, a man who looked like that?
BILL. Plenty of men look like that.
HARRY. That's true. That's very true. The only thing is that this particular man was here last night.
BILL. Was he? I didn't see him.
HARRy. Oh yes, he was here, but I've got a funny feeling he wore a mask. It was the same man, but he wore a mask, that's all there is to it. He didn't dance here last night, did he, or do any gymnastics?
BILL. No one danced here last night.
HARRY. Aah. Well, that's why you didn't notice his wooden leg. I couldn't help seeing it myself when he came to the front door because he stood on the top step stark naked.
Didn't seem very cold, though. He had a waterbottle under his arm instead of a hat.
BILL. Those church bells have certainly left their mark on you.
HARRY. They haven't helped, but the fact of the matter is, old chap, that I don't like strangers coming into my house without an invitation. (Pause.) Who is this man and what does he want?
Pause. BILL rises.
BILL. Will you excuse me? I really think it's about time I was dressed, don't you?
BILL goes up the stairs.
HARRY, after a moment, turns and follows. He slowly ascends the stairs.
Fade to blackout on house.
In the flat JAMES is still reading the paper. STELLA is sitting silently.
Silence.
STELLA. What do you think about going for a run today ... in the country?
Pause. JAMES puts the paper down.
JAMES. I've come to a decision.
STELLA. What?
JAMES. I'm going to go and see him.
STELLA. See him? Who? (Pause.) What for?
JAMES. Oh ... have a chat with him.
STELLA. What's the point of doing that?
JAMES. I feel I'd like to.
STELLA. I just don't see ... what there is to be gained.
What's the point of it?
Pause.
What are you going to do, hit him?
JAMES. No, no. I'd just like to hear what he's got to say.
STELLA. Why?
JAMES. I want to know what his attitude is.
Pause.
STELLA. He doesn't matter.
JAMES. What do you mean?
STELLA. He's not important.
JAMES. Do you mean anyone would have done? You mean it just happened to be him, but it might as well have been anyone?
STELLA. No.
JAMES. What then?
STELLA. Of course it couldn't have been anyone. It was him.
It was just ... something...
JAMES. That's what I mean. It was him. That's why I think he's worth having a look at. I want to see what he's like It'll be instructive, educational.
Pause.
STELLA. Please don't go and see him. You don't know where he lives, anyway.
JAMES. You don't think I should see him?
STELLA. It won't... make you feel any better.
JAMES. I want to see if he's changed.
STELLA. What do you mean?
JAMES. I want to see if he's changed from when I last saw him. He may have gone down the drain since I last saw him.
I must say he looked in good shape, though.
STELLA. You've never seen him.
Pause.
You don't know him.
Pause.
You don't know where he lives?
Pause.
When did you see him?
JAMES. We had dinner together last night.
STELLA. What?
JAMES. Splendid host.
STELLA. I don't believe it.
JAMES. Ever been to his place?
Pause.
Rather nice. Ever been there?
STELLA. I met him in Leeds, that's all.
JAMES. Oh, is that all. Well, we'll have to go round there one night. The grub's good, I can't deny it. I found him quite charming.
Pause.
He remembered the occasion well. He was perfectly frank.
You know, a man's man. Straight from the shoulder. He entirely confirmed your story.
STELLA. Did he?
JAMES. Mmm. Only thing ... he rather implied that you led him on. Typical masculine thing to say, of course.
STELLA. That's a lie.
JAMES. You know what men are. I reminded him that you'd resisted, and you'd hated the whole thing, but that you'd been - how can we say - somehow hypnotized by him, it happens sometimes. He agreed it can happen sometimes.
He told me he'd been hypnotized once by a cat. Wouldn't go into any more details, though. Still, I must admit we rather hit it off. We've got the same interests. He was most amusing over the brandy.
STELLA. I'm not interested.
IAMES. In fact, he was most amusing over the whole thing.
STELLA. Was he?
JAMES. But especially over the brandy. He's got the right attitude, you see. As a man, I can only admire it.
STELLA. What is his attitude?
JAMES. What's your attitude?
STELLA. I don't know what you're ... I just don't know what you're ... I just ... hoped you'd understand...
She covers her face, crying.
JAMeS. Well, I do understand, but only after meeting him.
Now I'm perfectly happy. I can see it both ways, three ways, all ways . • . every way. It's perfectly clear, there's nothing to it, everything's back to normal. The only difference is that I've come across a man I can respect. It isn't often you can do that, that that happens, and really I suppose I've got you to thank.
He bends forward and pats her arm.
Thanks.
Pause.
He reminds me of a bloke I went to school with. Hawkins. Honestly, he reminded me of Hawkins. Hawkins was an opera fan, too. So's what's-his-name. I'm a bit of an opera fan myself. Always kept it a dead secret. I might go along with your bloke to the opera one night. He says he can always get free seats. He knows quite a few of that crowd. Maybe I can track old Hawkins down and take him along, too. He's a very cultivated bloke, your bloke, quite a considerable intelligence at work there, I thought. He's got a collection of Chinese pots stuck on a wall, must have cost at least fifteen hundred a piece. Well, you can't help noticing that sort of thing. I mean, you couldn't say he wasn't a man of taste. He's brimming over with it. Well, I suppose he must have struck you the same way. No, really, I think I should thank you, rather than anything else. After two years of marriage it looks as though, by accident, you've opened up a whole new world for me.
Fade to blackout.
Fade up house. Night.
BILL comes in from the kitchen with a tray of olives, cheese, crisps, and a transistor radio, playing Vivaldi, very quietly. He puts the tray on the table, arranges the cushions and eats a crisp. JAMES appears at the front door and rings the bell. BILL goes to the door, opens it, amd JAMES comes in. In the hall he helps JAMES off with his coat.
JAMES comes into the room, BILL follows. JAMES notices the tray with the olives, and smiles. BILL smiles. JAMES goes up to the Chinese vases and examines them. BILl pours drinks. In the flat the telephone rings.
Fade up on flat. Night.
Fade up half light on telephone box.
A figure can be dimly seen in the telephone box. STELLA enters from the bedroom, holding the kitten. She goes to the telephone. BILL gives JAMES a glass. They drink.
STELLA. Hullo.
HARRY. Is that you, James?
STELLA. What? No, it isn't. Who's this?
HARRY. Where's James?
STELLA. He's out.
HARRY. Out? Oh, well, all right. I'll be straight round.
STELLA. What are you talking about? Who are you?
HARRY. Don't go out.
The telephone cuts off. STELLA replaces the receiver and sits upright with the kitten on the chair.
Fade to half light on flat.
Fade telephone box.
JAMES. You know something? You remind me of a chap I knew once. Hawkins. Yes. He was quite a tall lad.
BILL. Tall, was he?
JAMES. Yes.
BILL. Now why should I remind you of him?
JAMES. He was quite a card. (Pause.)
BILL. Tall, was he?
JAMES. That's ... what he was.
BILL. Well, you're not short.
JAMES. I'm not tall.
BILL. Quite broad.
JAMES. That doesn't make me tall.
BILL. I never said it did.
JAMES. Well, what are you saying?
BILL. Nothing. (Pause.)
JAMES. I wouldn't exactly say I was broad, either.
BILL. Well, you only see yourself in the mirror, don't you?
JAMES. That's good enough for me.
BILL. They're deceptive.
JAMES. Mirrors?
BILL. Very.
JAMES. Have you got one?
BILL. What?
JAMES. A mirror.
BILL. There's one right in front of you.
JAMES. So there is.
JAMES looks into the mirror.
Come here. You look in it, too.
BIlL stands by him and looks. They look together, and then JAMES goes to the left of the mirror, and looks again ai
BILL'S reflection.
I don't think mirrors are deceptive.
JAMES sits. BILL smiles, and turns up the radio. They sit listening.
Fade to half light on house and radio out.
Fade up full on flat.
Doorbell.
STELLA rises and goes off to the front door. The voices are heard off.
STELLA. Yes?
HARRY. How do you do. My name's Harry Kane. I wonder if I might have a word with you. There's no need to be alarmed. May I come in ?
STELLA. Yes.
HARRY (entering). In here?
STELLA. Yes.
They come into the room.
HARRY. What a beautiful lamp.
STELLA. What can I do for you?
HARRY. Do you know Bill Lloyd?
STELLA. No.
HARRY. Oh, you don't?
STELLA. No.
HARRY. You don't know him personally?
STELLA. I don't, no.
HARRY. I found him in a slum, you know, by accident. Just happened to be in a slum one day and there he was. I realized he had talent straight away. I gave him a roof, gave him a job, and he came up trumps. We've been close friends for years.
STELLA. Oh yes?
HARRY. You know of him, of course, don't you, by repute?
He's a dress designer.
STELLA. I know of him.
HARRY. You're both dress designers.
STELLA. Yes.
HARRY. You don't belong to the Rags and Bags Club, do you ?.
STELLA. The what?
HARRY. The Rags and Bags Club. I thought I might have seen you down there.
STELLA. No, I don't know it.
HARRY. Shame. You'd like it.
Pause.
Yes.
Pause.
I've come about your husband.
STELLA. Oh?
HARRY. Yes. He's been bothering Bill recently, with some fantastic story.
STELLA. I know about it. I'm very sorry.
HARRY. Oh, you know? Well, it's really been rather disturb-ing. I mean, the boy has his work to get on with. This sort of thing spoils his concentration.
STELLA. I'm sorry. It's ... very unfortunate.
HARRY. It is.
Pause.
STELLA. I can't understand it. We've been happily married for two years, you see. I've ... been away before, you know ... showing dresses, here and there, my husband runs the business. But it's never happened before.
HARRY. What hasn't?
STELLA. Well, that my husband has suddenly dreamed up such a fantastic story, for no reason at all.
HARRY. That's what I said it was. I said it was a fantastic story.
STELLA. It is.
HARRY. That's what I said and that's what Bill says. We both think it's a fantastic story.
STELLA. I mean, Mr. Lloyd was in Leeds, but I hardly saw him, even though we were staying in the same hotel. I never met him or spoke to him... and then my husband suddenly accused me of ... it's really been very distressing.
HARRY. Yes. What do you think the answer is? Do you think your husband... doesn't trust you, or something?
STELLA. Of course he does - he's just not been very well lately, actually ... overwork.
HARRY. That's bad. Still, you know what it's like in our business. Why don't you take him on a long holiday?
South of France.
STELLA. Yes. I'm very sorry that Mr. Lloyd has had to put up with all this, anyway.
HARRY. Oh, what a beautiful kitten, what a really beautiful kitten. Kitty, kitty, kitty, what do you call her, come here, kitty, kitty.
HARRY sits next to STELLA and proceeds to pet and nuzzle the kitten.
Fade flat to half light.
Fade up full on house.
BILL and JAMES, with drinks in the same position.
Music comes up. BILL turns off the radio.
Music out.
BILL. Hungry?
JAMES. No.
BILL. Biscuit?
JAMES. I'm not hungry.
BILL. I've got some olives.
JAMES. Really ?
BILL. Like one?
JAMES. No, thanks.
BILL. Why not?
JAMES. I don't like them.
Pause.
BILL. Don't like olives?
Pause.
What on earth have you got against olives?
Pause.
JAMES. I detest them.
BILL. Really ?
JAMES. It's the smell I hate.
Pause.
BILL. Cheese? I've got a splendid cheese knife.
He picks up a cheese knife.
Look. Don't you think it's splendid?
JAMES. Is it sharp?
BILL. Try it. Hold the blade. It won't cut you. Not if you handle it properly. Not if you grasp it firmly up to the hilt.
JAMES does not touch the knife.
BILL stands holding it.
Lights in house remain.
Fade up flat to full.
HARRY (standing). Well, good-bye, I'm glad we've had our little chat.
STELLA. Yes.
HARRY. It's all quite clear now.
STELLA. I'm glad.
They move to the door.
HARRY. Oh, Mr. Lloyd asked me if I would give you his best wishes ... and sympathies.
He goes out. She stands still.
Good-bye.
The front door closes. STELLA lies on the sofa with the kitten. She rests her head, is still.
Fade flat to half light.
BILL. What are you frightened of?
JAMES (moving away). What's that ?
BILL. What?
JAMES. I thought it was thunder.
BILL (to him.) Why are you frightened of holding this blade?
JAMES. I'm not frightened. I was just thinking of the thunder last week, when you and my wife were in Leeds.
BILL. Oh, not again, surely? I thought we'd left all that behind. Surely we have? You're not still worried about that, are you?
JAMES. Oh no. Just nostalgia, that's all.
BILL. Surely the wound heals when you know the truth, doesn't it? I mean, when the truth is verified? I would have thought it did.
JAMES. Of course.
BILL. What's there left to think about? It's a thing regretted, never to be repeated. No past, no future. Do you see what I mean? You're a chap who's been married for two years, aren't you happily? There's a bond of iron between you and your wife. It can't be corroded by a trivial thing like this. I've apologized, she's apologized. Honestly, what more can you want?
Pause. JAMES looks at him. BILL smiles. HARRY appears at the front door, opens and closes it quietly, and remains in the hall, unnoticed by the others.
JAMES. Nothing.
BILL. Every woman is bound to have an outburst of .. wild sensuality at one time or another. That's the way I look at it, anyway. It's part of their nature. Even though it may be the kind of sensuality of which you yourself have never been the fortunate recipient. What? (He laughs.) That is a husband's fate, I suppose. Mind you, I think it's the system that's at fault, not you. Perhaps she'll never need to do it again, who knows.
JAMES stands, goes to the fruit bowl, and picks up the fruit knife. He runs his finger along the blade.
JAMES. This is fairly sharp.
BILL. What do you mean?
JAMES. Come on.
BILL. I beg your pardon?
JAMES. Come on. You've got that one. I've got this one.
BILL. What about it?
JAMES. I get a bit tired of words sometimes, don't you? Let's have a game. For fun.
BILL. What sort of game?
JAMES. Let's have a mock duel.
BILL. I don't want a mock duel, thank you.
JAMES. Of course you do. Come on. First one who's touched is a sissy.
BILL. This is all rather unsubtle, don't you think?
JAMES. Not in the least. Come on, into first position.
BILL. I thought we were friends.
JAMES. Of course we're friends. What on earth's the matter with you? I'm not going to kill you. It's just a game, that's all. We're playing a game. You're not windy, are you?
BILL. I think it's silly.
JAMES. I say, you're a bit of a spoilsport, aren't you?
BILL. I'm putting my knife down anyway.
JAMES. Well, I'll pick it up.
JAMES does so and faces him with two knives.
BILL. Now you've got two.
JAMES. I've got another one in my hip pocket.
Pause.
BILL. What do you do, swallow them?
JAMES. Do you?
Pause. They stare at each other.
(Suddenly.) Go on! Swallow it!
JAMES throws a knife at BILL's face. BILL throws up a hand to protect his face and catches the knife by the blade. It cuts his hand.
BILL. Ow!
JAMES. Well caught! What's the matter?
He examines BILL's hand.
Let's have a look. Ah yes. Now you've got a scar on your hand. You didn't have one before, did you?
HARRY comes into the room.
HARRY (entering). What have you done, nipped your hand?
Let's have a look. (To JAMES.) Only a little nip, isn't it?
It's his own fault for not ducking. I must have told him dozens of times, you know, that if someone throws a knife at you the silliest thing you can do is to catch it. You're bound to hurt yourself, unless it's made of rubber. The safest thing to do is duck. You're Mr. Horne?
JAMES. That's right.
HARRY. I'm so glad to meet you. My name's Harry Kane.
Bill been looking after you all right? I asked him to see that you stayed until I got back. So glad you could spare the time. What are we drinking? Whisky? Let's fill you up.
You and your wife run that little boutique down the road, don't you? Funny we've never met, living so close, all in the same trade, eh? Here you are. Got one, Bill? Where's your glass? This one? Here... you are. Oh, stop rubbing your hand, for goodness' sake. It's only a cheese knife.
Well, Mr. Horne, all the very best. Here's wishing us all health, happiness and prosperity in the time to come, not forgetting your wife, of course. Healthy minds in healthy bodies. Cheers.
They drink.
By the way, I've just seen your wife. What a beautiful kitten she has. You should see it, Bill; it's all white. We had a very pleasant chat, your wife and I. Listen... old chap... can I be quite blunt with you?
JAMES. Of course.
HARRY. Your wife... you see... made a little tiny confession to me. I think I can use that word.
Pause.
BILL is sucking his hand.
What she confessed was … that she'd made the whole thing up. She'd made the whole damn thing up. For some odd reason of her own. They never met, you see, Bill and your wife; they never even spoke. This is what Bill says, and this is now what your wife admits. They had nothing whatever to do with each other; they don't know each other. Women are very strange. But I suppose you know more about that than I do; she's your wife. If I were you I'd go home and knock her over the head with a saucepan and tell her not to make up such stories again.
Pause.
JAMES. She made the whole thing up, eh?
HARRY. I'm afraid she did.
JAMES. I see. Well, thanks very much for telling me.
HARRY. I thought it would be clearer for you, coming from someone completely outside the whole matter.
JAMES. Yes. Thank you.
HARRY. Isn't that so, Bill ?
BILL. Oh, quite so. I don't even know the woman. Wouldn't know her if I saw her. Pure fantasy.
JAMES. How's your hand ?
BILL. Not bad.
JAMES. Isn't it strange that you confirmed the whole of her story?
BILL. It amused me to do so.
JAMES. Oh?
BILL. Yes. You amused me. You wanted me to confirm it. It amused me to do so.
Pause..
HARRY. Bill's a slum boy, you see, he's got a slum sense of humour. That's why I never take him along with me to parties. Because he's got a slum mind. I have nothing against slum minds per se, you understand, nothing at all. There's a certain kind of slum mind which is perfectly all right in a slum, but when this kind of slum mind gets out of the slum it sometimes persists, you see, it rots everything. That's what Bill is. There's something faintly putrid about him, don't you find? Like a slug. There's nothing wrong with slugs in their place, but he's a slum slug; there's nothing wrong with slum slugs in their place, but this one won't keep his place - he crawls all over the walls of nice houses, leaving slime, don't you, boy? He confirms stupid sordid little stories just to amuse himself, while everyone else has to run round in circles to get to the root of the matter and smooth the whole thing out. All he can do is sit and suck his bloody hand and decompose like the filthy putrid slum slug he is. What about another whisky, Horne?
JAMES. No, I think I must be off now. Well, I'm glad to hear that nothing did happen. Great relief to me.
HARRY. It must be.
JAMES. My wife's not been very well lately, actually. Over-work.
HARRY. That's bad. Still, you know what it's like in our business.
JAMES. Best thing to do is take her on a long holiday, I think.
HARRY. South of France.
JAMES. The Isles of Greece.
HARRY. Sun's essential, of course.
JAMES. I know. Bermuda.
HARRY. Perfect.
JAMES. Well, thanks very much, Mr. Kane, for clearing my mind. I don't think I'll mention it when I get home. Take her out for a drink or something. Forget all about it.
HARRY. Better hurry up. It's nearly closing time.
JAMES moves to BILL, who is sitting.
JAMES. I'm very sorry I cut your hand. You're lucky you caught it, of course. Otherwise it might have cut your mouth. Still, it's not too bad, is it?
Pause.
Look.. I really think I ought to apologize for this silly story my wife made up. The fault is really all hers, and mine, for believing her. You're not to blame for taking it as you did. The whole thing must have been an impossible burden for you. What do you say we shake hands, as a testimony of my goodwill ?
JAMES extends his hand. BILL rubs his hand but does not extend it.
HARRY. Come on, Billy, I think we've had enough of this stupidity, don't you?
Pause.
BILL. I'll ... tell you ... the truth.
HARRY. Oh, for God's sake, don't be ridiculous. Come on, Mr. Horne, off you go now, back to your wife, old boy, leave this... tyke to me.
JAMES does not move. He looks down at BILL.
Come on, Jimmy, I think we've had enough of this stupidity don't you?
JAMES looks at him sharply.
HARRY stops still.
BILL. I never touched her… we sat… in the lounge, on a sofa... for two hours ... talked… we talked about it… we didn't ... move from the lounge... never went to her room... just talked… about what we would do... if we did get to her room... two hours ... we never touched... we just talked about it...
Long silence.
JAMES leaves the house.
HARRY sitS. BILL remains sitting sucking his hand.
Silence.
Fade house to half light.
Fade up full on flat.
STELLA is lying with the kitten.
The flat door closes. JAMES comes in. He stands looking at her.
JAMES. You didn't do anything, did you?
Pause.
He wasn't in your room. You just talked about it, in the lounge.
Pause.
That's the truth, isn't it?
Pause.
You just sat and talked about what you would do if you went to your room. That's what you did.
Pause.
Didn't you?
Pause.
That's the truth ... isn't it?
STELLA looks at him, neither confirming nor denying. Her face is friendly, sympathetic.
Fade flat to half light.
The four figures are still, in the half light.
Fade to blackout.
Curtain
The stage consists of two areas. Living-room right, with small hall and front door up centre. Bedroom and balcony, on a level, left.
There is a short flight of stairs to bedroom door. Kitchen off right.
A table with a long velvet cover stands against the left wall of the living-room, centre stage. In the small hall there is a cupboard.
The furnishings are tasteful, comfortable.
SARAH is emptying and dusting ashtrays in the living-room. It is morning. She wears a crisp, demure dress. RICHARD comes into the bedroom from bathroom, off left, collects his briefcase from hall cupboard, goes to SARAH, kisses her on the cheek. He looks at her for a moment smiling. She smiles.
RICHARD (amiably). Is your lover coming today?
SARAH. Mmnn.
RICHARD. What time?
SARAH. Three.
RICHARD. Will you be going out ... or staying in?
SARAH. Oh... I think we'll stay in.
RICHARD. I thought you wanted to go to that exhibition.
SARAH. I did, yes... but I think I'd prefer to stay in with him today.
RICHARD. Mmn-hmmn. Well, I must be oft.
He goes to the hall and puts on his bowler hat.
RICHARD. Will he be staying long do you think?
SARAH. Mmmnnn …
RICHARD. About... six, then.
SARAH. Yes.
RICHARD. Have a pleasant afternoon.
SARAH. Mmnn.
RICHARD. Bye-bye.
SARAH. Bye.
He opens the front door and goes out. She continues dusting.
The lights fade.
Fade up. Early evening. SARAH comes into room from kitchen.
She wears the same dress, but is now wearing a pair of very high-heeled shoes. She pours a drink and sits on chaise longue with magazine. There are six chimes of the clock. RICHARD comes in the front door. He wears a sober suit, as in the morning. He puts his briefcase down in the hall and goes into the room. She smiles at him and pours him a whisky.
Hullo.
RICHARD. Hullo.
He kisses her on the cheek. Takes glass, hands her the evening paper and sits down left. She sits on chaise longue with paper.
Thanks.
He drinks, sits back and sighs with contentment.
Aah.
SARAH. Tired?
RICHARD. Just a little.
SARAH. Bad traffic?
RICHARD. No. Quite good traffic, actually.
SARAH. Oh, good.
RICHARD. Very smooth.
Pause.
SARAH. It seemed to me you were just a little late.
RICHARD. Am I ?
SARAH. Just a little.
RICHARD. There was a bit of a jam on the bridge.
SARAH gets up, goes to drinks table to collect her glass, sits again on the chaise longue.
Pleasant day?
SARAH. Mmn. I was in the village this morning.
RICHARD. Oh yes? See anyone?
SARAH. Not really, no. Had lunch.
RICHARD. In the village?
SARAH. Yes.
RICHARD. Any good?
SARAH. Quite fair. (She sits.)
RICHARD. What about this afternoon? Pleasant afternoon?
SARAH. Oh yes. Quite marvellous.
RICHARD. Your lover came, did he?
SARAH. Mmnn. Oh yes.
RICHARD. Did you show him the hollyhocks ?
Slight pause.
SARAH. The hollyhocks?
RICHARD. Yes.
SARAH. No, I didn't.
RICHARD. Oh.
SARAH. Should I have done?
RICHARD. No, no. It's simply that I seem to remember your saying he was interested in gardening.
SARAH. Mmnn, yes, he is.
Pause.
Not all that interested, actually.
RICHARD. Ah.
Pause.
Did you go out at all, or did you stay in?
SARAH. We stayed in.
RICHARD. Ah. (He looks up at the Venetian blinds.) That blind hasn't been put up properly.
SARAH. Yes, it is a bit crooked, isn't it?
Pause.
RICHARD. Very sunny on the road. Of course, by the time 1 got on to it the sun was beginning to sink. But I imagine it was quite warm here this afternoon. It was warm in the City.
SARAH. Was it?
RICHARD. Pretty stifling. I imagine it was quite warm every-where.
SARAH. Quite a high temperature, I believe.
RICHARD. Did it say so on the wireless?
SARAH. I think it did, yes.
Slight pause.
RICHARD. One more before dinner ?
SARAH. Mmn.
He pours drinks.
RICHARD. I see you had the Venetian blinds down.
SARAH. We did, yes.
RICHARD. The light was terribly strong.
SARAH. It was. Awfully strong.
RICHARD. The trouble with this room is that it catches the sun so directly, when it's shining. You didn't move to another room?
SARAH. No. We stayed here.
RICHARD. Must have been blinding.
SARAH. It was. That's why we put the blinds down.
Pause.
RICHARD. The thing is it gets so awfully hot in here with the blinds down.
SARAH. Would you say so?
RICHARD. Perhaps not. Perhaps it's just that you feel hotter.
SARAH. Yes. That's probably it.
Pause.
What did you do this afternoon?
RICHARD. Long meeting. Rather inconclusive.
SARAH. It's a cold supper. Do you mind?
RICHARD. Not in the least.
SARAH. I didn't seem to have time to cook anything today.
She moves towards the kitchen.
RICHARD. Oh, by the way ... I rather wanted to ask you something.
SARAH. What ?
RICHARD. Does it ever occur to you that while you're spending the afternoon being unfaithful to me I'm sitting at a desk going through balance sheets and graphs?
SARAH. What a funny question.
RICHARD. No, I'm curious.
SARAH. You've never asked me that before.
RICHARD. I've always wanted to know.
Slight pause.
SARAH. Well, of course it occurs to me.
RICHARD. Oh, it does?
SARAH. Mmnn.
Slight pause.
RICHARD. What's your attitude to that, then?
SARAH. It makes it all the more piquant.
RICHARD. Does it really?
SARAH. Of course.
RICHARD. You mean while you're with him... you actually have a picture of me, sitting at my desk going through balance sheets?
SARAH. Only at ... certain times.
RICHARD. Of course.
SARAH. Not all the time.
RICHARD. Well, naturally.
SARAH. At particular moments.
SARAH. Not by any means.
RICHARD. Mmnn. But, in fact, I'm not completely forgoten:
RICHARD. That's rather touching, I must admit.
Pause.
SARAH. How could I forget you?
RICHARD. Quite easily, I should think.
SARAH. But I'm in your house.
RICHARD. With another.
SARAH. But it's you I love.
RICHARD. I beg your pardon?
SARAH. But it's you I love.
Pause. He looks at her, proffers his glass.
RICHARD. Let's have another drink.
She moves forward. He withdraws his glass, looks at her shoes.
What shoes are they?
SARAH. Mmnn?
RICHARD. Those shoes. They're unfamiliar. Very high-heeled, aren't they?
SARAH (muttering). Mistake. Sorry.
RICHARD (not hearing). Sorry? I beg your pardon?
SARAH. I'll ... take them off.
RICHARD. Not quite the most comfortable shoes for an evening at home, I would have thought.
She goes into hall, opens cupboard, purs high-heeled shoes into cupboard, puts on low-heeled shoes. He moves to drinks table, pours himself a drink. She moves to centre table, lights a cigarette.
So you had a picture of me this afternoon, did you, sitting in my office?
SARAH. I did, yes. It wasn't a terribly convincing one, though.
RICHARD. Oh, why not?
SARAH. Because I knew you weren't there. I knew you were with your mistress.
Pause.
RICHARD. Was I?
Short pause.
SARAH. Aren't you hungry?
RICHARD. I had a heavy lunch.
SARAH. How heavy?
He stands at the window.
RICHARD. What a beautiful sunset.
SARAH. Weren't you?
He turns and laughs.
RICHARD. What mistress?
SARAH. Oh, Richard…
RICHARD. No, no, it's simply the word that's so odd.
SARAH. Is it? Why?
Slight pause.
I'm honest with you, aren't I? Why can't you be honest with me?
RICHARD. But I haven't got a mistress. I'm very well acquainted with a whore, but I haven't got a mistress. There's a world of difference.
SARAH. A whore?
RICHARD (taking an olive). Yes. Just a common or garden slut.
Not worth talking about. Handy between trains, nothing more.
SARAH. You don't travel by train. You travel by car.
RICHARD. Quite. A quick cup of while cocoa they're checking the oil and water.
Pause.
SARAH. Sounds utterly sterile
RICHARD. No.
Pause.
SARAH. I must say I never expected you to admit it so readily.
RICHARD. Oh, why not? You've never put it to me so blundy before, have you? Frankness at all costs. Essential to a healthy marriage. Don't you agree?
SARAH. Of course.
RICHARD. You agree.
SARAH. Entirely.
RICHARD. I mean, you're utterly frank with me, aren't you?
SARAH. Utterly.
RICHARD. About your lover. I must follow your example.
SARAH. Thank you.
Pause.
Yes, I have suspected it for some time.
RICHARD. Have you really?
SARAH. Mmnn.
RICHARD. Perceptive.
SARAH. But, quite honestly, I can't really believe she's just… what you say.
RICHARD. Why not?
SARAH. It's just not possible. You have such taste. You care so much for grace and elegance in women.
RICHARD. And wit.
SARAH. And wit, yes.
RICHARD. Wit, yes. Terribly important, wit, for a man.
SARAH. Is she witty?
RICHARD (laughing). These terms just don't apply. You can't sensibly inquire whether a whore is witty. It’s of no significance whether she is or she isn't. She's simply a whore, a functionary who either pleases or displeases.
SARAH. And she pleases you ?
RICHARD. Today she is pleasing. Tomorrow...? One can't say.
He moves towards the bedroom door taking off his jacket.
SARAH. I must say I find your attitude to women rather
alarming.
RICHARD. Why? I wasn't looking for your double, was I? I wasn't looking for a woman I could respect, as you, whom I could admire and love, as I do you. Was I? All I wanted was... how shall I put it... someone who could express and engender lust with all lust's cunning. Nothing more.
He goes into the bedroom, hangs his jacket up in the ward-robe, and changes into his slippers.
In the living-room SARAH puts her drink down, hesitates and then follows into the bedroom.
SARAH. I'm sorry your affair possesses so little dignity.
RICHARD. The dignity is in my marriage.
SARAH. Or sensibility.
RICHARD. The sensibility likewise. I wasn't looking for such attributes. I find them in you.
SARAH. Why did you look at all?
Slight pause.
RICHARD. What did you say?
SARAH. Why look ... elsewhere ... at all ?
RICHARD. But my dear, you looked. Why shouldn't I look?
Pause.
SARAH. Who looked first?
RICHARD. You.
SARAH. I don't think that's true.
RICHARD. Who, then?
She looks at him with a slight smile.
Fade up. Night. Moonlight on balcony. The lights fade.
RICHARD comes in bedroom door in his pyjamas. He picks up a book and looks at it. SARAH comes from bathroom in her nightdress. There is a double bed. SARAH sits at the dressing-table. Combs her hair.
SARAH. Richard?
RICHARD. Mnn?
SAith her you ever think about mac at all ... when your
RICHARD. Oh, a little. Not much.
Pause.
We talk about you.
SARAH. You talk about me with her?
RICHARD. Occasionally. It amuses her.
SARAH. Amuses her?
RICHARD (choosing a book). Mmnn.
SARAH. How ... do you talk about me?
RICHARD. Delicately. We discuss you as we would play an antique music box. We play it for our titillation, whenever desired.
Pause.
SARAH. I can't pretend the picture gives me great pleasure.
RICHARD. It wasn't intended to. The pleasure is mine.
SARAH. Yes, I see that, of course.
RICHARD (sitting on the bed). Surely your own afternoon pleasures are sufficient for you, aren't they? You don't expect extra pleasure from my pastimes, do you?
SARAH. No, not at all.
RICHARD. Then why all the questions?
SARAH. Well, it was you who started it. Asking me so many
questions about ... my side of it. You don't normally do
that.
RICHARD. Objective curiosity, that's all.
He touches her shoulders.
You're not suggesting I'm jealous, surely?
She smiles, stroking his hand.
SARAH. Darling. I know you'd never stoop to that.
RICHARD. Good God, no.
He squeezes her shoulder.
What about you? You're not jealous, are you?
SARAH. No. From what you tell me about your lady I seem to have a far richer time than you do.
RICHARD. Possibly.
He opens the windows fully and stands by them, looking out.
What peace. Come and look.
She joins him at the window.
They stand silently.
What would happen if I came home early one day, I wonder ?
Pause.
SARAH. What would happen if I followed you one day, I wonder?
Pause.
RICHARD. Perhaps we could all meet for tea in the village.
SARAH. Why the village? Why not here?
RICHARD. Here? What an extraordinary remark.
Pause.
Your poor lover has never seen the night from this window, has he?
SARAH. No. He's obliged to leave before sunset, unfortunately.
RICHARD. Doesn't he get a bit bored with these damn afternoons? This eternal teatime? I would. To have as the constant image of your lust a milk jug and teapot. Must be terribly dampening.
SARAH. He's very adaptable. And, of course, when one puts the blinds down it does become a kind of evening.
RICHARD. Yes, I suppose it would.
Pause.
What does he think of your husband?
Slight pause.
SARAH. He respects you.
Pause.
RICHARD. I'm rather moved by that remark, in a strange kind of way. I think I can understand why you like him so much.
SARAH. He's terribly sweet.
RICHARD. Mmn-hmmnn.
SARAH. Has his moods, of course.
RICHARD. Who doesn't?
SARAH. But I must say he's very loving. His whole body emanates love.
RICHARD. How nauseating.
SARAH. No.
RICHARD. Manly with it, I hope?
SARAH. Entirely.
RICHARD. Sounds tedious.
SARAH. Not at all.
Pause.
He has a wonderful sense of humour.
RICHARD. Oh, jolly good. Makes you laugh, does he? Well, mind the neighbours don't hear you. The last thing we want is gossip.
Pause.
SARAH. It's wonderful to live out here, so far away from the main road, so secluded.
RICHARD. Yes, I do agree.
They go back into the room. They get into the bed. He picks up his book and looks at it. He closes it and puts it down.
This isn't much good.
He switches off his bedside lamp. She does the same.
Moonlight.
He's married, isn't he?
SARAH. Mmmmn.
RICHARD. Happily?
SARAH. Mmmmn.
Pause.
And you're happy, aren't you? You're not in any way jealous ?
RICHARD. No.
SARAH. Good. Because I think things are beautifully balanced, Richard.
Fade.
Fade up. Morning. SARAH putting on her negligee in the bedroom. She begins to make the bed.
SARAH. Darling.
Pause.
Will the shears be ready this morning?
RICHARD (in bathroom, off). The what?
SARAH. The shears.
RICHARD. No, not this morning.
He enters, fully dressed in his suit. Kisses her on the cheek.
Not till Friday. Bye-bye.
He leaves the bedroom, collects hat and briefcase from hall.
SARAH. Richard.
He turns.
You won't be home too early today, will you?
RICHARD. Do you mean he's coming again today? Good gracious. He was here yesterday. Coming again today?
SARAH. Yes.
RICHARD. Oh. No, well, I won't be home early. I'll go to the National Gallery.
SARAH. Right.
RICHARD. Bye-bye.
SARAH. Bye.
The lights fade.
Fade up. Afternoon. SARAH comes downstairs into living room. She wears a very tight, low-cut black dress. She hastily looks at herself in the mirror. Suddenly notices she is wearing low-heeled shoes. She goes quickly to cupboard changes them for her high-heeled shoes. Looks again in mirror, smooths her hips. Goes to window, pulls venetian blinds down, opens them, and closes them until there is a slight slit of light. There are three chimes of a clock. She looks at her watch, goes towards the flowers on the table. Door bell. She goes to door. It is the milkman, JOHN.
JOHN. Cream?
SARAH. You're very late.
JOHN. Cream?
SARAH. No, thank you.
JOHN. Why not?
SARAH. I have some. Do I owe you anything?
JOHN. Mrs. Owen just had three jars. Clotted.
SARAH. What do I owe you?
JOHN. It's not Saturday yet.
SARAH (taking the milk). Thank you.
JOHN. Don't you fancy any cream ? Mrs. Owen had three jars.
SARAH. Thank you.
She closes the door. Goes into the kitchen with milk. Comes back with a tea-tray, holding teapot and cups, sets it on small table above chaise longue. She briefly attends to the flowers, sits on the chaise longue, crosses her legs, uncrosses them, puts her legs up on chaise longue, smooths her stockings under her skirt. The doorbell rings. Pulling her dress down she moves 10 the door, opens it.
Hallo, Max.
RICHARD comes in. He is wearing a suede jacket, and no tie.
He walks into the room and stands.
She closes the door behind him. Walks slowly down past him, and sits on the chaise longue, crossing her legs.
Pause.
He moves slowly to chaise longue and stands very close to her at her back. She arches her back, uncrosses her legs, moves away to low chair down left.
Pause.
He looks at her, then moves towards the hall cupboard, brings our a bongo drum. He places the drum on the chaise longue, stands.
Pause.
She rises, moves past him towards the hall, turns, looks at him.
He moves below chaise. They sit at either end. He begins to tap the drum. Her forefinger moves along drum towards his hand. She scratches the back of his hand sharply. Her hand retreats. Her fingers tap one after the other towards him, and rest. Her forefinger scratches between his fingers. Her other fingers do the same. His legs tauren. His hand clasps hers.
Her hand tries to escape. Wild beats of their fingers tangling.
Stillness.
She gets up, goes to drinks table, lights a cigarette, moves to window. He puts drum down on chair down right, picks up cigarette, moves to her.
MAX. Excuse me.
She glances at him and away.
Excuse me, have you got a light?
She does not respond.
Do you happen to have a light?
SARAH. Do you mind leaving me alone?
MAX. Why?
Pause.
I'm merely asking if you can give me a light.
She moves from him and looks up and down the room. He follows to her shoulder. She turns back.
SARAH. Excuse me.
She moves past him. Close, his body follows.
She stops.
I don't like being followed.
MAX. Just give me a light and I won't bother you. That's all I want.
SARAH (through her teeth). Please go away. I'm waiting for someone.
MAX. Who?
SARAH. My husband.
MAX. Why are you so shy? Eh? Where's your lighter?
He touches her body. An indrawn breath from her.
Here?
Pause.
Where is it?
He touches her body. A gasp from her.
Here?
She wrenches herself away. He traps her in the corner.
SARAH (hissing). What do you think you're doing?
MAX. I'm dying for a puff.
SARAH. I'm waiting for my husband!
MAX. Let me get a light from yours.
They struggle silently.
She breaks away to wall.
Silence.
He approaches.
Are you all right, miss? I've just got rid of that ... gentleman. Did he hurt you in any way?
SARAH. Oh, how wonderful of you. No, no, I'm all right.
Thank you.
MAX. Very lucky I happened to be passing. You wouldn't believe that could happen in such a beautiful park.
SARAH. No, you wouldn't.
MAX. Still, you've come to no harm.
SARAH. I can never thank you enough. I'm terribly grateful, I really am.
MAX. Why don't you sit down a second and calm yourself.
SARAH. Oh, I'm quite calm - but ... yes, thank you. You're so kind. Where shall we sit.
MAX. Well, we can't sit out. It's raining. What about that park-keeper's hut?
SARAH. Do you think we should? I mean, what about the park-keeper ?
MAX. I am the park-keeper.
They sit on the chaise longue.
SARAH. I never imagined I could meet anyone so kind.
MAX. To treat a lovely young woman like you like that, it's unpardonable.
SARAH (gazing at him). You seem so mature, so ... appreciative.
MAX. Of course.
SARAH. So gentle. So… Perhaps it was all for the best.
MAX. What do you mean?
SARAH. So that we could meet. So that we could meet. You and I.
Her fingers trace his thigh. He stares at them, lifts them off.
MAX. I don't quite follow you.
SARAH. Don't you?
Her fingers trace his thigh. He stares at them, lifts them off.
MAX. Now lock, I'm sorry. I'm married.
She takes his hand and puts it on her knee.
SARAH. You're so sweet, you mustn't worry.
MAX (snatching his hand away). No, I really am. My wife's waiting for me.
SARAH. Can't you speak to strange girls?
MAX. No.
SARAH. Oh, how sickening you are. How tepid.
MAX. I'm sorry.
SARAH. You men are all alike. Give me a cigarette.
MAX. I bloody well won't.
SARAH. I beg your pardon?
MAX. Come here, Dolores.
SARAH. Oh no, not me. Once bitten twice shy, thanks. (She stands.) Bye-bye.
MAX. You can't get out, darling. The hut's locked. We're alone. You're trapped.
SARAH. Trapped! I'm a married woman. You can't treat me like this.
MAX (moving to her). It's teatime, Mary.
She moves swiftly behind the table and stands there with her back to the wall. He moves to the opposite end of the table, hitches his trousers, bends and begins to crawl under the table towards her.
He disappears under the velvet cloth. Silence. She stares down at the table. Her legs are hidden from view. His hand is on her leg. She looks about, grimaces, grits her teeth, gasps, gradually sinks under the table, and disappears. Long silence.
HER VOICE. Max!
Lights fade.
Fade up.
MAX sitting on chair down left.
SARAH pouring tea.
SARAH. Max.
MAX. What?
SARAH (fondly). Darling.
Slight pause.
What is it? You're very thoughtful.
MAX. No.
SARAH. You are. I know it.
Pause.
MAX. Where's your husband?
Pause.
SARAH. My husband? You know where he is.
MAX. Where?
SARAH. He's at work.
MAX. Poor fellow. Working away, all day.
Pause.
I wonder what he's like.
SARAH (chuckling). Oh, Max.
MAX. I wonder if we'd get on. I wonder if we'd ... you know ... hit it off.
SARAH. I shouldn't think so.
MAX. Why not?
SARAH. You've got very little in common.
MAX. Have we? He's certainly very accommodating. I mean, he knows perfectly well about these afternoons of ours, doesn't he ?
SARAH. Of course.
MAX. He's known for years.
Slight pause.
Why does he put up with it?
SARAH. Why are you suddenly talking about him? 1 mean what's the point of it? It isn't a subject you normally elaborate on.
MAX. Why does he put up with it?
SARAH. Oh, shut up.
MAX. I asked you a question.
Pause.
SARAH. He doesn't mind.
MAX. Doesn't he?
Slight pause.
Well, I'm beginning to mind.
Pause.
SARAH. What did you say.
MAX. I'm beginning to mind.
Slight pause.
It's got to stop. It can't go on.
SARAH. Are you serious ?
Silence.
MAX. It can't go on.
SARAH. You're joking.
MAS. No, I'm not.
SARAH. Why? Because of my husband? Not because of my husband, I hope. That's going a little far, I think.
MAX. No, nothing to do with your husband. It's because of my wife.
Pause.
SARAH. Your wife?
MAX. I can't deceive her any longer.
SARAH. Max…
MAX. I've been deceiving her for years. I can't go on with it.
It's killing me.
SARAH. But darling, look - 
MAX. Don't touch me.
Pause.
SARAH. What did you say?
MAX. You heard.
Pause.
SARAH. But your wife ... knows. Doesn't she? You've told her ... all about us. She's known all the time.
MAX. No, she doesn't know. She thinks I know a whore, that's all. Some spare-time whore, that's all. That's what she
thinks.
SARAH. Yes, but be sensible... my love ... she doesn't mind, does she?
MAX. She'd mind if she knew the truth, wouldn't she?
SARAH. What truth? What are you talking about?
MAX. She'd mind if she knew that, in fact... I've got a full-time mistress, two or three times a week, a woman of grace, elegance, wit, imagination SARAH. Yes, yes, you have -
MAX. In an affair that's been going on for years.
SARAH. She doesn't mind, she wouldn't mind - she's happy,
She's happy.
Pause.
I wish you'd stop this rubbish, anyway.
She picks up the tea-tray and moves towards the kitchen.
You're doing your best to ruin the whole afternoon.
She takes the tray out. She then returns, looks at MAX and goes to him.
Darling. You don't really think you could have what we have with your wife, do you? I mean, my husband, for instance, completely appreciates that I -
MAX. How does he bear it, your husband? How does he bear it? Doesn't he smell me when he comes back in the evenings? What does he say? He must be mad. Now - what's the time - half-past four - now when he's sitting in his office, knowing what's going on here, what does he feel, how does he bear it?
SARAH. Max -
MAX. How?
SARAH. He's happy for me. He appreciates the way I am. He \ understands.
MAX. Perhaps I should meet him and have a word with him.
SARAH. Are you drunk?
MAS. Perhaps I should do that. After all, he's a man, like me.
We're both men. You're just a bloody woman.
She slams the table.
SARAH. Stop it! What's the matter with you? What's happened to you? (Quietly.) Please, please, stop it. What are you doing, playing a game?
MAX. A game? I don't play games.
SARAH. Don't you? You do. Oh, you do. You do. Usually I like them.
MAx. I've played my last game.
SARAH. Why?
Slight pause.
MAX. The children.
Pause.
SARAH. What?
MAX. The children. I've got to think of the children.
SARAH. What children?
MAX. My children. My wife's children. Any minute now they'll be out of boarding school. I've got to think of them.
She sits close to him.
SARAH. I want to whisper something to you. Listen. Let me whisper to you. Mmmm? Can I? Please? It's whispering time. Earlier it was teatime, wasn't it? Wasn't it? Now it's whispering time.
Pause.
You like me to whisper to you. You like me to love you, whispering. Listen. You mustn't worry about ... wives, husbands, things like that. It's silly. It's really silly. It's you, you now, here, here with me, here together, that's what it is, isn't it? You whisper to me, you take tea with me, you do that, don't you, that's what we are, that's us, love me.
He stands up.
MAX. You're too bony.
He walks away.
That's what it is, you see. I could put up with everything if it wasn't for that. You're too bony.
SARAH. Me? Bony? Don't be ridiculous.
MAX. I'm not.
SARAH. How can you say I'm bony?
MAX. Every move I make, your bones stick into me. I'm sick and tired of your bones.
SARAH. What are you talking about?
MAX. I'm telling you you're too bony.
SARAH. But I'm fat! Look at me. I'm plump anyway. You always told me I was plump.
MAX. You were plump once. You're not plump any more.
SARAH. Look at me.
He looks.
MAX. You're not plump enough. You're nowhere near plump chough. You know what I like. I like enormous women.
Like bullocks with udders. Vast great uddered bullocks.
SARAH. You mean cows.
MAX. I don't mean cows. I mean voluminous great uddered feminine bullocks. Once, years ago, you vaguely resembled
one.
SARAH. Oh, thanks.
MAX. But now, quite honestly, compared to my ideal ...
He stares at her.
... you're skin and bone.
They stare at each other.
He puts on his jacket.
SARAH. You're having a lovely joke.
MAX. It's no joke.
He goes out. She looks after him. She turns, goes slowly towards the bongo drum, picks it up, puts it in the cup-board. She turns, looks at chaise a moment, walks slowly into the bedroom, sits on the end of the bed. The lights fade.
Fade up. Early evening. Six chimes of the clock. RICHARD comes in the front door. He is wearing his sober suit. He puts his briefcase in cupboard, hat on hook, looks about the room, pours a drink. SARAH comes into the bedroom from bathroom, wearing a sober dress. They both stand quite still in the two rooms for a few moments. SARAH moves to the balcony, looks out, RICHARD comes into the bedroom.
RICHARD. Hello.
Pause.
SARAH. Hello.
RICHARD. Watching the sunset?
He picks up a bottle.
Drink?
SARAH. Not at the moment, thank you.
RICHARD. Oh, what a dreary conference. Went on all day.
Terribly fatiguing. Still, good work done, I think. Something achieved. Sorry I'm rather late. Had to have a drink with one or two of the overseas people. Good chaps.
He sits.
How are you?
SARAH. Fine.
RICHARD. Good.
Silence.
You seem a little depressed. Anything the matter?
SARAH. No.
RICHARD. What sort of day have you had?
SARAH. Not bad.
RICHARD. Not good?
Pause.
SARAH. Fair.
RICHARD. Oh, I'm sorry.
Pause.
Good to be home, I must say. You can't imagine what a comfort it is.
Pause.
Lover come?
She does not reply.
Sarah?
SARAH. What? Sorry. I was thinking of something RICHARD. Did your lover come?
SARAH. Oh yes. He came.
RICHARD. In good shape?
SARAH. I have a headache actually.
RICHARD. Wasn't he in good shape?
Pause.
SARAH. We all have our off days.
RICHARD. He, too? I thought the whole point of being a lover is that one didn't. I mean if I, for instance, were called upon to fulfil the function of a lover and felt disposed, shall we say, to accept the job, well, I'd as soon give it up as be found incapable of executing its proper and consistent obligation.
SARAH. You do use long words.
RICHARD. Would you prefer me to use short ones?
SARAH. No, thank you.
Pause.
RICHARD. But I am sorry you had a bad day.
SARAH. It's quite all right.
RICHARD. Perhaps things will improve.
SARAH. Perhaps.
Pause.
I hope so.
She leaves the bedroom, goes into the living-room, lights a cigarette and sits. He follows.
RICHARD. Nevertheless, I find you very beautiful.
SARAH. Thank you.
RICHARD. Yes, I find you very beautiful. I have great pride in being seen with you. When we're out to dinner, or at the theatre.
SARAH. I'm so glad.
RICHARD. Or at the Hunt Ball.
SARAH. Yes, the Hunt Ball.
RICHARD. Great pride, to walk with you as my wife on my arm. To see you smile, laugh, walk, talk, bend, be still.
To hear your command of contemporary phraseology, your delicate use of the very latest idiomatic expression, so subtly employed. Yes. To feel the envy of others, their attempts to gain favour with you, by fair means or foul, your austere grace confounding them. And to know you are my wife. It's a source of a profound satisfaction to me.
Pause.
What's for dinner.
SARAH. I haven't thought.
RICHARD. Oh, why not ?
SARAH. I find the thought of dinner fatiguing. I prefer not to think about it.
RICHARD. That's rather unfortunate. I'm hungry.
Slight pause.
You hardly expect me to embark on dinner after a day spent sifting matters of high finance in the City.
She laughs.
One could even suggest you were falling down on your wifely duties.
SARAH. Oh dear.
RICHARD. I must say I rather suspected this would happen, sooner or later.
Pause.
SARAH. How's your whore?
RICHARD. Splendid.
SARAH. Fatter or thinner?
RICHARD. I beg your pardon?
SARAH. Is she fatter or thinner?
RICHARD. She gets thinner every day.
SARAH. That must displease you.
RICHARD. Not at all. I'm fond of thin ladies.
SARAH. I thought the contrary.
RICHARD. Really? Why would you have thought that?
Pause.
Of course, your failure to have dinner on the table is quite consistent with the life you've been leading for some time, isn't it?
SARAH. Is it?
RICHARD. Entirely.
Slight pause.
Perhaps I'm being unkind. Am I being unkind ?
SARAH (looks at him). I don't know.
RICHARD. Yes, I am. In the traffic jam on the bridge just now, you see, I came to a decision.
Pause.
SARAH. Oh? What?
RICHARD. That it has to stop.
SARAH. What?
RICHARD. Your debauchery.
Pause.
Your life of depravity. Your path of illegitimate lust.
SARAH. Really?
RICHARD. Yes, I've come to an irrevocable decision on that point.
She stands.
SARAH. Would you like some cold ham?
RICHARD. Do you understand me?
SARAH. Not at all. I have something cold in the fridge.
RICHARD. Too cold, I'm sure. The fact is this is my house.
From today, I forbid you to entertain your lover on these premises. This applies to any time of the day. Is that
understood.
SARAH. I've made a salad for you.
RICHARD. Are you drinking?
SARAH. Yes, I'll have one.
RICHARD. What are you drinking?
SARAR. You know what I drink. We've been married ten years.
RICHARD. So we have.
He pours.
It's strange, of course, that it's taken me so long to appreciate the humiliating ignominy of my position.
SARAH. I didn't take my lover ten years ago. Not quite. Not on the honeymoon.
RICHARD. That's irrelevant. The fact is I am a husband who has extended to his wife's lover open house on any afternoon of her desire. I've been too kind. Haven't I been too kind?
SARAH. But of course. You're terribly kind.
RICHARD. Perhaps you would give him my compliments, by letter if you like, and ask him to cease his visits from (He consults calendar.) - the twelfth inst.
Long silence.
SARAH. How can you talk like this?
Pause.
Why today... so suddenly ?
Pause.
Mmmm?
She is close to him.
You've had a hard day ... at the office. All those overseas people. It's so tiring. But it's silly, it's so silly, to talk like this. I'm here. For you. And you've always appreciated ... how much these afternoons... mean. You've always understood.
She presses her cheek to his.
Understanding is so rare, so dear.
RICHARD. Do you think it's pleasant to know that your wife is unfaithful to you two or three times a week, with great regularity?
SARAH. Richard -
RICHARD. It's insupportable. It has become insupportable.
I'm no longer disposed to put up with it.
SARAH (to him). Sweet... Richard... please.
RICHARD. Please what?
She stops.
Can I tell you what I suggest you do?
SARAH. What ?
RICHARD. Take him out into the fields. Find a ditch. Or a slag heap. Find a rubbish dump. Mmmm? What about that?
She stands still.
Buy a canoe and find a stagnant pond. Anything. Anywhere.
But not my living-room.
SARAH. I'm afraid that's not possible.
RICHARD. Why not?
SARAH. I said it's not possible.
RICHARD. But if you want your lover so much, surely that's the obvious thing to do, since his entry to this house is now barred. I'm trying to be helpful, darling, because of my love for you. You can see that. If I find him on these premises I'll kick his teeth out.
SARAH. You're mad.
He stares at her.
RICHARD. I'll kick his head in.
Pause.
SARAH. What about your own bloody whore?
RICHARD. I've paid her off.
SARAH, Have you? Why?
RICHARD. She was too bony.
Slight pause.
SARAH. But you liked… you said you liked... Richard… but you love me...
RICHARD. Of course.
SARAH. Yes... you love me... you don't mind him… you understand him… don't you? ... I mean, you know better than I do... darling... all's well... all's well ... the evenings... and the afternoons... do you see?
Listen, I do have dinner for you. It's ready. I wasn't serious.
It's Boeuf bourgignon. And tomorrow I'll have Chicken Chasseur. Would you like it?
They look at each other.
RICHARD (softly). Adulteress.
SARAH. You can't talk like this, it's impossible, you know you can't. What do you think you're doing?
He remains looking at her for a second, then moves into the hall.
He opens the hall cupboard and takes out the bongo drum.
She watches him.
He returns.
RICHARD. What's this ? I found it some time ago. What is it?
Pause.
What is it?
SARAH. You shouldn't touch that.
RICHARD. But it's in my house. It belongs either to me, or to you, or to another.
SARAH. It's nothing. I bought it in a jumble sale. It's nothing.
What do you think it is ? Put it back.
RICHARD. Nothing? This? A drum in my cupboard ?
SARAH. Put it back!
RICHARD. It isn't by any chance anything to do with your illicit afternoons?
SARAH. Not at all. Why should it?
RICHARD. It is used. This is used, isn't it? I can guess.
SARAH. You guess nothing. Give it to me.
RICHARD. How does he use it? How do you use it? Do you play it while I'm at the office?
She tries to take the drum. He holds on to it. They are still; hands on the drum.
What function does this fulfil ? It's not just an ornament, I take it? What do you do with it?
SARAH (with quiet anguish). You've no right to question me.
No right at all. It was our arrangement. No questions of this kind. Please. Don't, don't. It was our arrangement.
RICHARD. I want to know.
She closes her eyes.
SARAH. Don't ...
RICHARD. Do you both play it? Mmmmnn? Do you both play it? Together?
She moves away swiftly, then turns, hissing.
SARAH. You stupid...! (She looks at him coolly.) Do you think he's the only one who comes! Do you? Do you think he's the only one I entertain? Mmmnn? Don't be silly. I have other visitors, other visitors, all the time, I receive all the time.
Other afternoons, all the time. When neither of you know, neither of you. I give them strawberries in season. With cream. Strangers, total strangers. But not to me, not while they're here. They come to see the hollyhocks. And then they stay for tea. Always. Always.
RICHARD. Is that so?
He moves towards her, tapping the drum gently.
He faces her, tapping, then grasps her hand and scratches it across the drum.
SARAH. What are you doing?
RICHARD. Is that what you do?
She jerks away, to behind the table.
He moves towards her, tapping.
Like that?
Pause.
What fun.
He scratches the drum sharply and then places it on the chair.
Got a light?
Pause.
Got a light?
She retreats towards the table, eventually ending behind it.
Come on, don't be a spoilsport. Your husband won't mind, if you give me a light. You look a little pale. Why are you so pale? A lovely girl like you.
SARAH. Don't, don't say that!
RICHARD. You're trapped. We're alone. I've locked up.
SARAH. You mustn't do this, you mustn't do it, you mustn't!
RICHARD. He won't mind.
He begins to move slowly closer to the table.
No one else knows.
Pause.
No one else can hear us. No one knows we're here.
Pause.
Come on. Give us a light.
Pause.
You can't get out, darling. You're trapped.
They face each other from opposite ends of the table.
She suddenly giggles.
Silence.
SARAH. I'm trapped.
Pause.
What will my husband say?
Pause.
He expects me. He's waiting. I can't get out. I'm trapped.
You've no right to treat a married woman like this. Have you? Think, think, think of what you're doing.
She looks at him, bends and begins to crawl under the table towards him. She emerges from under the table and kneels at his feet, looking up. Her hand goes up his leg. He is looking down at her.
You're very forward. You really are. Oh, you really are.
But my husband will understand. My husband does understand. Come here. Come down here. I'll explain. After all, think of my marriage. He adores me. Come here and I'll whisper to you. I'll whisper it. It's whispering time. Isn't it?
She takes his hands. He sinks to his knees, with her. They are kneeling together, close. She strokes his face.
It's a very late tea. Isn't it? But I think I like it. Aren't you sweet? I've never seen you before after sunset. My husband's at a late-night conference. Yes, you look different.
Why are you wearing this strange suit, and this tie? You usually wear something else, don't you? Take off your jacket. Mmmnn? Would you like me to change? Would you like me to change my clothes? I'll change for you, darling. Shall I ? Would you like that?
Silence. She is very close to him.
RICHARD. Yes.
Pause.
Change.
Pause.
Change.
Pause.
Change your clothes.
Pause.
You lovely whore.
They are still, kneeling, she leaning over him.
THE END
Scene: A basement room. Iwo beds, flat against the back wall. A serving hatch, closed, between the beds. A door to the kitchen and lavatory, left. A door to a passage, right.
BEN is lying on a bed, left, reading a paper. GUS is sitting on a bed, right, tying his shoelaces, with difficulty. Both are dressed in shirts, trousers and braces.
Silence.
GUS ties his laces, rises, yawns and begins to walk slowly to the door, left. He stops, looks down, and shakes his foot.
BEN lowers his paper and watches him. GUS kneels and unties his shoe-lace and slowly takes off the shoe. He looks inside it and brings out a flattened matchbox. He shakes it and examines it.
Their eyes meet. BEN rattles his paper and reads. GUS puts the marchbox in his pocket and bends down to put on his shoe. He ties his lace, with difficulty. BEN lowers his paper and watches him.
GUS walks to the door, left, stops, and shakes the other foot.
He kneels, unties his shoe-lace, and slowly takes off the shoe. He looks inside it and brings out a flattened cigarette packet. He shakes it and examines it. Their eyes meet. BEN rattles his paper and reads. GUS puts the packer in his pocket, bends down, puts on his shoe and ties the lace.
He wanders off, left.
BEN slams the paper down on the bed and glares after him. He picks up the paper and lies on his back, reading.
Silence.
A lavatory chain is pulled twice off, left, but the lavatory does not flush.
Silence.
GUS re-enters, left, and halts at the door, scratching his head.
BEN slams down the paper.
BEN. Kaw!
He picks up the paper.
What about this? Listen to this!
He refers to the paper.
A man of eighty-seven wanted to cross the road. But there was a lot of traffic, see? He couldn't see how he was going to squeeze through. So he crawled under a lorry.
GUS. He what?
BEN. He crawled under a lorry. A stationary lorry.
GUS. No?
BEN. The lorry started and ran over him.
GUS. Go on!
BEN. That's what it says here.
GUS. Get away.
BEN. It's enough to make you want to puke, isn't it?
GUS. Who advised him to do a thing like that?
BEN. A man of eighty-seven crawling under a lorry!
GUS. It's unbelievable.
BEN. It's down here in black and white.
GUS. Incredible.
Silence.
GUS shakes his head and exits. BEN lies back and reads.
The lavatory chain is pulled once off left, but the lavatory does not flush.
BEN whistles at an item in the paper.
GUS re-enters.
I want to ask you something.
BEN. What are you doing out there?
GUS. Well, I was just - 
BEN. What about the tea?
GUS. I'm just going to make it.
BEN. Well, go on, make it.
GuS. Yes, I will. (He sits in a chair. Ruminatively.) He's laid on some very nice crockery this time, I'll say that. It's sort of striped. There's a white stripe.
BEN reads.
I's very nice. I'll say that.
BEN turns the page.
You know, sort of round the cup. Round the rim. All the rest of it's black, you see. Then the saucer's black, except for right in the middle, where the cup goes, where it's white.
BEN reads.
Then the plates are the same, you see. Only they've got a black stripe - the plates - right across the middle. Yes, I'm quite taken with the crockery.
BEN (still reading). What do you want plates for? You're not going to eat.
GUS. I've brought a few biscuits.
BEN. Well, you'd better eat them quick.
GUS. I always bring a few biscuits. Or a pie. You know I can't drink tea without anything to eat.
BEN. Well, make the tea then, will you? Time's getting on.
GUS brings out the flattened cigarette packet and examines it.
GUS. You got any cigarettes? I think I've run out.
He throws the packet high up and leans forward to carch it.
I hope it won't be a long job, this one.
Aiming carefully, he flips the packet under his bed.
Oh, I wanted to ask you something.
BEN (slamming his paper down). Kaw!
GUS. What's that?
BEN. A child of eight killed a cat!
GUS. Get away.
BEN. IT's a fact, What about that, eh? A child of eight killing a cat!
GUS. How did he do it?
BEN. It was a girl.
GUS. How did she do it?
BEN. She-
He picks up the paper and studies it.
It doesn't say.
GUS. Why not?
BEN. Wait a minute. It just says - Her brother, aged eleven, viewed the incident from the toolshed.
GUS. Go on!
BEN. That's bloody ridiculous.
Pause.
GUS. I bet he did it.
BEN. Who?
GUS. The brother.
BEN. I think you're right.
Pause.
(Slamming down the paper.) What about that, eh? A kid of eleven killing a cat and blaming it on his little sister of eight.
It's enough to -
He breaks off in disgust and seizes the paper. GUs rises.
GUS. What time is he getting in touch?
BEN reads.
What time is he getting in touch?
BEN. What's the matter with you? It could be any time. Any GUS (moves to the foot of BEN's bed). Well, I was going to ask you something.
BEN. What?
GUS. Have you noticed the time that tank takes to fil?
BEN. What tank?
GUs. In the lavatory.
BEN. No. Does it?
GUS. Terrible.
BEN. Well, what about it?
GUS. What do you think's the matter with it?
BEN. Nothing.
GUS. Nothing?
BEN. It's got a deficient ballcock, that's all.
GUS. A deficient what?
BEN. Ballcock.
GUS. No? Really?
BEN. That's what I should say.
GUS. Go on! That didn't occur to me.
GUS wanders to his bed and presses the mattress.
I didn't have a very restful sleep today, did you? It's not much of a bed. I could have done with another blanket too.
(He catches sight of a picture on the wall.) Hello, what's this?
(Peering at it.) 'The First Eleven.' Cricketers. You seen this, Ben?
BEN (reading). What?
GUS. The first eleven.
BEN. What?
GUS. There's a photo here of the first eleven.
BEN. What first eleven?
GUS (studying the photo). It doesn't say.
BEN. What about that tea?
GUS. They all look a bit old to me.
GuS wanders downstage, looks out front, then all about the room.
I wouldn't like to live in this dump. I wouldn't mind if you bad a window, you could see what it looked like outside.
BEN. What do you want a window for?
Gus. Well, I like to have a bit of a view, Ben. It whiles away the time.
He walks about the room.
I mean, you come into a place when it's still dark, you come into a room you've never seen before, you sleep all day, you do your job, and then you go away in the night again.
Pause.
I like to get a look at the scenery. You never get the chance in this job.
BEN. You get your holidays, don't you?
GUS. Only a fortnight.
BEN lowering the paper). You kill me. Anyone would think you're working every day. How often do we do a job? Once a week? What are you complaining about?
GUS. Yes, but we've got to be on tap though, haven't we? You can't move out of the house in case a call comes.
BEN. You know what your trouble is?
GUS. What?
BEN. You haven't got any interests.
GUS. I've got interests.
BEN. What? Tell me one of your interests.
Pause.
GUS. I've got interests.
BEN. Look at me. What have I got?
GUS. I don't know. What?
BEN. I've got my woodwork. I've got my model boats. Have you ever seen me idle? I'm never idle. I know how to occupy my time, to its best advantage. Then when a call comes, I'm ready.
GUS. Don't you ever get a bit fed up?
BEN. Fed up? What with?
Silence.
BEN reads. GUS feels in the pocket of his jacket, which hangs on the bed.
GUS. You got any cigarettes? I've run out.
The lavatory flushes off left.
There she goes.
GUS sits on his bed.
No, I mean, I say the crockery's good. It is. It's very nice.
But that's about all I can say for this place. It's worse than the last one. Remember that last place we were in? Last time, where was it? At least there was a wireless there. No, honest.
He doesn't seem to bother much about our comfort these days.
BEN. When are you going to stop jabbering?
GUS. You'd get rheumatism in a place like this, if you stay long.
BEN. We're not staying long. Make the tea, will you? We'll be on the job in a minute.
GUS picks up a small bag by his bed and brings out a packet of tea. He examines it and looks up.
GUS. Eh, I've been meaning to ask you.
BEN. What the hell is it now?
GUS. Why did you stop the car this morning, in the middle of that road?
BEN (lowering the paper). I thought you were asleep.
GUS. I was, but I woke up when you stopped. You did stop, didn't you?
Pause.
In the middle of that road. It was still dark, don't you remember? I looked out. It was all misty. I thought perhaps you wanted to kip, but you were sitting up dead straight, like you were waiting for something.
BEN. I wasn't waiting for anything.
GUs. I must have fallen asleep again. What was all that about then? Why did you stop?
BEN (picking up the paper). We were too early.
GUS. Early? (He rises.) What do you mean? We got the all, didn't we, saying we were to start right away. We did. We shoved out on the dot. So how could we be too early?
BEN (quietly). Who took the call, me or you?
GUS. You.
BEN. We were too early.
GUS. Too early for what?
Pause.
You mean someone had to get out before we got in?
He examines the bedclothes.
I thought these sheets didn't look too bright. I thought they ponged a bit. I was too tired to notice when I got in this morning. Eh, that's taking a bit of a liberty, isn't it? I don't want to share my bed-sheets. I told you things were going down the drain. I mean, we've always had clean sheets laid on up till now. I've noticed it.
BEN. How do you know those sheets weren't clean?
GUS. What do you mean?
BEN. How do you know they weren't clean? You've spent the whole day in them, haven't you?
GUS. What, you mean it might be my pong? (He sniffs sheets.)
Yes. (He sits slowly on bed.) It could be my pong, I suppose.
It's difficult to tell. I don't really know what I pong like, that's the trouble.
BEN (referring to the paper). Kaw!
GUS. Eh, Ben.
BEN. Kaw!
GUS. Ben.
BEN. What?
GUS. What town are we in? I've forgotten.
BEN. I've told you. Birmingham.
GUS. Go on!
He looks with interest about the room.
That's in the Midlands. The second biggest city in Great Britain. I'd never have guessed.
He snaps his fingers.
Eh, it's Friday today, isn't it? It'll be Saturday tomorrow.
BEN. What about it?
GUS (excited). We could go and watch the Villa.
BEN. They're playing away.
GUS. No, are they? Caarr! What a pity.
BEN. Anyway, there's no time. We've got to get straight back.
GUS. Well, we have done in the past, haven't we? Stayed over and watched a game, haven't we? For a bit of relaxation.
BEN. Things have tightened up, mate. They've tightened up.
GUS chuckles to himself.
GUS. I saw the Villa get beat in a cup-tie once. Who was it against now? White shirts. It was one-all at half-time. I'll never forget it. Their opponents won by a penalty. Talk about drama. Yes, it was a disputed penalty. Disputed. They got beat two-one, anyway, because of it. You were there yourself.
BEN. Not me.
GUS. Yes, you were there. Don't you remember that disputed penalty?
BEN. No.
GUS. He went down just inside the area. Then they said he was just acting. I didn't think the other bloke touched him my-self. But the referee had the ball on the spot.
BEN. Didn't touch him! What are you talking about? He laid him out flat!
GUS. Not the Villa. The Villa don't play that sort of game.
Ben. Get out of it.
Pause.
GUS. Eh, that must have been here, in Birmingham.
BEN. What must?
GUS. The Villa. That must have been here.
BEN. They were playing away.
GUS. Because you know who the other team was? It was the Spurs. It was Tottenham Hotspur.
BEN. Well, what about it?
GUS. We've never done a job in Tottenham.
BEN. How do you know?
GUS. I'd remember Tottenham.
BEN turns on his bed to look at him.
BEN. Don't make me laugh, will you?
BEN turns back and reads. GUS yawns and speaks through his yawn.
GUS. When's he going to get in touch?
Pause.
Yes, I'd like to see another football match. I've always been an ardent football fan. Here, what about coming to see the Spurs tomorrow?
BEN (tonelessly). They're playing away.
GUS. Who are?
BEN. The Spurs.
GUS. Then they might be playing here.
BEN. Don't be silly.
GUs. If they're playing away they might be playing here. They might be playing the Villa.
BEN (tonelessly). But the Villa are playing away.
Pause. An envelope slides under the door, right. GUS sees it.
He stands, looking at it.
GUS. Вед.
BEN. Away. They're all playing away.
GUS. Ben, look here.
BEN. What?
GUS. Look.
BEN turns his head and sees the envelope. He stands.
BEN. What's that?
GUS. I don't know.
BEN. Where did it come from?
GUS. Under the door.
BEN. Well, what is it?
GUS. I don't know.
They stare at it.
BEN. Pick it up.
GUS. What do you mean?
BEN. Pick it up!
GUS slowly moves towards it, bends and picks it up.
What is it?
GUS. An envelope.
BEN. Is there anything on it?
GUS. No.
BEN. Is it sealed?
GUS. Yes.
BEN. Open it.
GUS. What?
BEN. Open it!
GUS opens it and looks inside.
What's in it?
GUS empties twelve matches into his hand.
GUS. Matches.
BEN. Matches?
GUS. Yes.
BEN. Show it to me.
GUS passes the envelope. BEN examines it.
GUS stares at him, puts the matches in his pocket, goes to his bed and brings a revolver from under the pillow. He goes to the door, opens it, looks out and shuts it.
GUS. No one.
Nothing on it. Not a word.
GUS. That's funny, isn't it?
BEN. It came under the door?
GUS. Must have done.
BEN. Well, go on.
GUS. Go on where?
BEN. Open the door and see if you can catch anyone outside.
GUS. Who, me?
BEN. Go on!
He replaces the revolver.
BEN. What did you see?
GUS. Nothing.
BEN. They must have been pretty quick.
Gus takes the marches from his pocket and looks at them.
GUS. Well, they'll come in handy.
BEN. Yes.
GUS. Won't they?
BEN. Yes, you're always running out, aren't you?
GUS. All the time.
BEN. Well, they'll come in handy then.
GUS. Yes.
BEN. Won't they?
GUS. Yes, I could do with them. I could do with them too.
BEN. You could, eh?
GUS. Yes.
BEN. Why?
GUS. We haven't got any.
BEN. Well, you've got some now, haven't you?
GuS. I can light the kettle now.
BEN. Yes, you're always cadging matches. How many have you got there?
GUS. About a dozen.
BEN. Well, don't lose them. Red too. Yeu don't even need a box.
GUS probes his ear with a match.
(Slapping his hand). Don't waste them! Go on, go and light it.
GUS. Eh?
BEN. Go and light it.
GUS. Light what?
BEN. The kettle.
GUS. You mean the gas.
BEN. Who does?
GUS. You do.
BEN (his eyes narrowing). What do you mean, I mean the gas?
GuS. Well, that's what you mean, don't you? The gas.
BEN (powerfully). If I say go and light the kettle I mean go and light the kettle.
GUS. How can you light a kettle?
BEN. It's a figure of speech! Light the kettle. It's a figure of speech!
GUS. I've never heard it.
BEN. Light the kettle! It's common usage!
Gus. I think you've got it wrong.
BEN (menacing). What do you mean?
GUS. They say put on the kettle.
BEN (taut). Who says?
They stare at each other, breathing hard.
(Deliberately.) I have never in all my life heard anyone say put on the kettle.
GUS. I bet my mother used to say it.
BEN. Your mother? When did you last see your mother?
GUS. I don't know, about -
BEN. Well, what are you talking about your mother for?
They stare.
Gus, I'm not trying to be unreasonable. I'm just trying to point out something to you.
GUS. Yes, but -
BEN. Who's the senior partner here, me or you?
GUS. You.
BEN. I'm only looking after your interests, Gus. You've got to learn, mate.
GUS. Yes, but I've never heard -
BEN (vehemently). Nobody says light the gas! What does the gas light?
GUS. What does the gas -?
BEN (grabbing him with two hands by the throat, at arm's length).
THE KETTLE, YOU FOOL!
GUS takes the hands from his throat.
GUS. All right, all right.
Pause.
BEN. Well, what are you waiting for?
GUS. I want to see if they light.
BEN. What?
GUS. The matches.
He takes out the flattened box and tries to strike.
No.
He throws the box under the bed.
BEN stares at him.
GUS raises his foot.
Shall I try it on here?
BEN stares. GUS strikes a match on his shoe. It lights.
Here we are.
BEN (wearily). Put on the bloody kettle, for Christ's sake.
BEN goes to his bed, but, realising what he has said, stops and half turns. They look at each other. GUS slowly exits, left. BEN slams his paper down on the bed and sits on it, head in hands.
GUS (entering). It's going.
BEN. What?
GUS. The stove.
GUS goes to his bed and sits.
I wonder who it'll be tonight.
Silence.
Eh, I've been wanting to ask you something.
BEN (putting his legs on the bed). Oh, for Christ's sake.
GUS. No. I was going to ask you something.
He rises and sits on BEN's bed.
BEN. What are you sitting on my bed for?
GUS sits.
What's the matter with you? You're always asking me questions. What's the matter with you?
GUS. Nothing.
BEN. You never used to ask me so many damn questions.
What's come over you?
GUS. No, I was just wondering.
BEN. Stop wondering. You've got a job to do. Why don't you just do it and shut up?
GUS. That's what I was wondering about.
BEN. What?
GUS. The job.
BEN. What job?
GUS (tentatively). I thought perhaps you might know some-thing.
BEN looks at him.
I thought perhaps you - I mean - have you got any idea - who it's going to be tonight?
BEN. Who what's going to be?
They look at each other.
GUS (at length). Who it's going to be.
Silence.
BEN. Are you feeling all right?
GUS. Sure.
BEN. Go and make the tea.
GUS. Yes, sure.
GUS exits, left, BEN looks after him. He then takes his revolver from under the pillow and checks it for ammunition. GUS re-enters.
The gas has gone out.
BEN. Well, what about it?
GUS. There's a meter.
BEN. I haven't got any money.
GUS. Nor have I.
BEN. You'll have to wait.
GUS. What for?
BEN. For Wilson.
GUS. He might not come. He might just send a message. He doesn't always come.
BEN. Well, you'll have to do without it, won't you?
Gus. Blimey.
BEN. You'll have a cup of tea afterwards. What's the matter with you?
Gus. I like to have one before.
BEN holds the revolver up to the light and polishes it.
BEN. You'd better get ready anyway.
GUS. Well, I don't know, that's a bit much, you know, for my money.
He picks up a packet of tea from the bed and throws it into the bag.
I hope he's got a shilling, anyway, if he comes. He's entitled to have. After all, it's his place, he could have seen there was enough gas for a cup of tea.
BEN. What do you mean, it's his place?
GUS. Well, isn't it?
BEN. He's probably only rented it. It doesn't have to be his place.
GUS. I know it's his place. I bet the whole house is. He's not even laying on any gas now either.
GUS sits on his bed.
It's his place all right. Look at all the other places. You go to this address, there's a key there, there's a teapot, there's never a soul in sight - (He pauses.) Eh, nobody ever hears a thing, have you ever thought of that? We never get any complaints, do we, too much noise or anything like that? You never see a soul, do you? - except the bloke who comes. You ever noticed that? I wonder if the walls are sound-proof. (He touches the wall above his bed.) Can't tell.
All you do is wait, eh? Half the time he doesn't even bother to put in an appearance, Wilson.
BEN. Why should he? He's a busy man.
GUS (thoughtfully). I find him hard to talk to, Wilson. Do you know that, Ben?
BEN. Scrub round it, will you?
Pause.
GUS. There are a number of things I want to ask him. But I can never get round to it, when I see him.
Pause.
I've been thinking about the last one.
BEN. What last one?
GUS. That girl.
BEN grabs the paper, which he reads.
(Rising, looking down at BEN). How many times have you read that paper?
BEN slams the paper down and rises.
BEN (angrily). What do you mean?
GUS. I was just wondering how many times you'd - 
BEN. What are you doing, criticizing me?
GUS. No, I was just -
BBN. You'll get a swipe round your earhole if you don't watch your step.
GUS. Now look here, Ben -
BEN. I'm not looking anywhere! (He addresses the room.) How many times have I - I A bloody liberty!
GUS. I didn't mean that.
BEN. You just get on with it, mate. Get on with it, that's all.
BEN gets back on the bed.
GUS. I was just thinking about that girl, that's all.
GUS sits on his bed.
She wasn't much to look at, I know, but still. It was a mess though, wasn't it? What a mess. Honest, I can't remember a mess like that one. They don't seem to hold together like men, women. A looser texture, like. Didn't she spread, eh?
She didn't half spread. Kaw! But I've been meaning to ask you.
BEN sits up and clenches his eyes.
Who clears up after we've gone? I'm curious about that.
Who does the clearing up? Maybe they don't clear up.
Maybe they just leave them there, eh? What do you think?
How many jobs have we done? Blimey, I can't count them.
What if they never clear anything up after we've gone.
BEN (pityingly). You mutt. Do you think we're the only branch of this organization? Have a bit of common. They got departments for everything.
GUS. What cleaners and all?
BEN. You birk!
GUS. No, it was that girl made me start to think -
There is a loud clatter and racket in the bulge of wall between the beds, of something descending. They grab their revolvers, jump up and face the wall. The noise comes to a stop. Silence. They look at each other. BEN gestures sharply towards the wall. GUS approaches the wall slowly. He bangs it with his revolver. It is hollow. BEN moves to the head of his bed, his revolver cocked. GUS puts his revolver on his bed and pats along the bottom of the centre panel. He finds a rim. He lifts the panel. Disclosed is a serving-hatch, a 'dumb waiter'. A wide box is held by pulleys. GUs peers into the box. He brings out a piece of paper.
BEN. What is it?
GUS. You have a look at it.
BEN. Read it.
GUS (reading). Two braised steak and chips. Two sago puddings. Two teas without sugar.
BEN. Let me see that. (He takes the paper.) 
GUS (to himself). Two teas without sugar.
BEN. Mmnn.
GUS. What do you think of that?
BEN. Well -
The box goes up. BEN levels his revolver.
GUS. Give us a chance! They're in a burry, aren't they?
BEN re-reads the note. GUS looks over his shoulder.
That's a bit - that's a bit funny, isn't it?
BEN (quickly). No. It's not funny. It probably used to be a café here, that's all. Upstairs. These places change hands very quickly.
GUS. A café?
BEN. Yes.
GUS. What, you mean this was the kitchen, down here?
BEN. Yes, they change hands overnight, these places. Go into liquidation. The people who run it, you know, they don't find it a going concern, they move out.
GUS. You mean the people who ran this place didn't find it a going concern and moved out?
BEN. Sure.
GUS. WELL, WHO'S GOT IT NOW?
Silence.
BEN. What do you mean, who's got it now?
GUS. Who's got it now? If they moved out, who moved in?
BEN. Well, that all depends -
The box descends with a clatter and bang. BEN levels his revolver. GUS goes to the box and brings out a piece of paper.
GUS (reading). Soup of the day. Liver and onions. Jam tart.
A pause. GUS looks at BEN. BEN takes the note and reads it.
He walks slowly to the hatch. GUS follows. BEN looks into the hatch but not up it. GUS puts his hand on BEN'S shoulder.
BEN throws it off. GUS puts his finger to his mouth. He leans on the hatch and swiftly looks up it. BEN flings him away in alarm. BEN looks at the note. He throws his revolver on the bed and speaks with decision.
BEN. We'd better send something up.
GUS. Eh?
BEN. We'd better send something up.
GUS. Oh! Yes. Yes. Maybe you're right.
They are both relieved at the decision.
BEN (purposefully). Quick! What have you got in that bag?
GUS. Not much.
GUS goes to the hatch and shouts up it.
Wait a minute!
BEN. Don't do that!
GUS examines the contents of the bag and brings them out, one by one.
GUS. Biscuits. A bar of chocolate. Half a pint of milk.
BEN. That all?
GUS. Packet of tea.
BEN. Good.
GUS. We can't send the tea. That's all the tea we've got.
BEN. Well, there's no gas. You can't do anything with it, can you?
GUS. Maybe they can send us down a bob.
BEN. What else is there?
GUS (reaching into bag). One Eccles cake.
BEN. One Eccles cake?
GUS. Yes.
BEN. You never told me you had an Eccles cake.
GUS. Didn't I?
BEN. Why only one? Didn't you bring one for me?
GUS. I didn't think you'd be keen.
BEN. Well, you can't send up one Eccles cake, anyway.
GUS. Why not?
BEN. Fetch one of those plates.
GUS. All right.
GUS goes towards the door, left, and stops.
Do you mean I can keep the Eccles cake then?
BEN. Keep it?
GUS. Well, they don't know we've got it, do they?
BEN. That's not the point.
GUS. Can't I keep it?
BEN. No, you can't. Get the plate.
GUS exits, left. BEN looks in the bag. He brings out a packet of crisps. Enter GUS with a plate.
(Accusingly, holding up the crisps). Where did these come from?
GUS. What?
BEN. Where did these crisps come from?
GUS. Where did you find them?
BEN hitting him on the shoulder). You're playing a dirty game, my lad!
GUS. I only eat those with beer!
BEN. Well, where were you going to get the beer?
GUS. I was saving them till I did.
BEN. I'll remember this. Put everything on the plate.
They pile everything on to the plate. The box goes up withou the plate.
Wait a minute!
They stand.
GuS. It's gone up.
BEN. It's all your stupid fault, playing about!
GUS. What do we do now?
BEN. We'll have to wait till it comes down.
BEN puts the plate on the bed, puts on his shoulder holster, and starts to put on his tie.
You'd better get ready.
Gus goes to his bed, puts on his tie, and starts to fix his holster.
GUS. Hey, Ben.
BEN. What?
GUs. What's going on here?
Pause.
BEN. What do you mean?
GUS. How can this be a café?
BEN. It used to be a café.
GUS. Have you seen the gas stove?
BEN. What about it?
GUS. It's only got three rings.
BEN. So what?
GUS. Well, you couldn't cook much on three rings, not for a busy place like this.
BEN (irritably). That's why the service is slow!
BEN puts on his waistcoat.
GUS. Yes, but what happens when we're not here? What do they do then? All these menus coming down and nothing going up. It might have been going on like this for years.
BEN brushes his jacket.
What happens when we go?
BEN puts on his jacket.
They can't do much business.
The box descends. They turn about. GUS goes to the hatch and brings out a note.
GUS (reading). Macaroni Pastisio. Ormitha Macarounda
BEN. What was that?
GUS. Macaroni Pastitsio. Ormitha Macarounada.
BEN. Greek dishes.
GUS. No.
BEN. That's right.
GUS. That's pretty high class.
BEN. Quick before it goes up.
GUS puts the plate in the box.
GUS (calling up the hatch). Three McVitie and Price! One Lyons Red Label! One Smith's Crisps! One Eccles cake!
One Fruit and Nut!
BEN. Cadbury's.
GUS (up the hatch). Cadbury's!
BEN (handing the milk). One bottle of milk.
GUS (up the hatch). One bottle of milk! Half a pint! (He Looks at the label.) Express Dairy! (He puts the bottle in the box.)
The box goes up.
just did it.
BEN. You shouldn't shout like that.
GUS. Why not?
BEN. It isn't done.
BEN goes to his bed.
Well, that should be all right, anyway, for the time being.
GUS. You think so, eh?
BEN. Get dressed, will you? It'll be any minute now.
Gus puts on his waistcoat. BEN lies down and looks up at the ceiling.
GUS. This is some place. No tea and no biscuits.
BEN. Eating makes you lazy, mate. You're getting lazy, you know that? You don't want to get slack on your job.
GUS. Who me?
BEN. Slack, mate, slack.
GUS. Who me? Slack?
BEN. Have you checked your gun? You haven't even checked your gun. It looks disgraceful, anyway. Why don't you ever polish it?
GUS rubs his revolver on the sheer. BEN takes out a pocket mirror and straightens his tie.
GUS. I wonder where the cook is. They must have had a few, to cope with that. Maybe they had a few more gas stoves.
Eh! Maybe there's another kitchen along the passage.
BEN. Of course there is! Do you know what it takes to make an Ormitha Macarounada?
GUS. No, what?
BEN. An Ormitha -! Buck your ideas up, will you?
GUS. Takes a few cooks, eh?
GUS puts his revolver in its holster.
The sooner we're out of this place the better.
He puts on his jacket.
Why doesn't he get in touch? I feel like I've been here years. He takes his revolver out of its holster to check the ammunition.) We've never let him down though, have we? We've never let him down. I was thinking only the other day, Ben. We're reliable, aren't we?
He puts his revolver back in its holster.
Still, I'll be glad when it's over tonight.
He brushes his jacket.
I hope the bloke's not going to get excited tonight, or any-thing. I'm feeling a bit off. I've got a splitting headache.
Silence.
The box descends. BEN jumps up.
GUS collects the note.
(Reading.) One Bamboo Shoots, Water Chestnuts
BEN. Beansprouts?
Chicken. One Char Siu and Beansprouts.
and
GUS. Yes.
BEN. Blimey.
GuS. I wouldn't know where to begin.
He looks back at the box. The packet of tea is inside it. He picks it up.
They've sent back the tea.
BEN anxious. What'd they do that for?
GUS. Maybe it isn't tea-time.
The box goes up. Silence.
BEN throwing the tea on the bed, and speaking urgently). Look here. We'd better tell them.
GUS. Tell them what?
BEN. That we can't do it, we haven't got it.
GUS. All right then.
BEN. Lend us your pencil. We'll write a note.
GUS, turning for a pencil, suddenly discovers the speaking-tube, which hangs on the right wall of the hatch facing his bed.
GUS. What's this?
BEN. What?
GUS. This.
BEN (examining it). This? It's a speaking-tube.
GUS. How long has that been there?
BEN. Just the job. We should have used it before, instead of shouting up there.
GUS. Funny I never noticed it before.
BEN. Well, come on.
GUS. What do you do?
BEN. See that? That's a whistle.
GUS. What, this?
BEN. Yes, take it out. Pull it out.
GUS does so.
That's it.
GUS. What do we do now?
BEN. Blow into it.
GUS. Blow?
BEN. It whistles up there if you blow. Then they know you want to speak. Blow.
GUS blows. Silence.
GUS (tube at mouth). I can't hear a thing.
BEN. Now you speak! Speak into it!
GUS looks at BEN, then speaks into the tube.
GUS. The larder's bare!
BEN. Give me that!
He grabs the tube and puts it to his mouth.
(Speaking with great deference.) Good evening. I'm sorry to
- bother you, but we just thought we'd better let you know that we haven't got anything left. We sent up all we had. There's no more food down here.
He brings the tube slowly to his ear.
What?
To mouth.
What?
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
No, all we had we sent up.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.
To ear. He listens. To GUS.
The Eccles cake was stale.
He listens. To GUS.
The chocolate was melted.
He listens. To GUS.
The milk was sour.
GUS. What about the crisps?
BEN (listening). The biscuits were mouldy.
He glares at GUS. Tube to mouth.
Well, we're very sorry about that.
Tube to eat.
What?
To mouth.
What?
To ear.
Yes. Yes.
To mouth.
Yes certainly. Certainly. Right away.
To ear. The voice has ceased. He hangs up the tube.
(Excitedly). Did you hear that?
GUS. What?
BEN. You know what he said? Light the kettle! Not put on the kettle! Not light the gas! But light the kettle!
GUS. How can we light the kettle?
BEN. What do you mean?
GUS. There's no gas.
BEN (clapping hand to head). Now what do we do?
GUs. What did he want us to light the kettle for?
BEN. For tea. He wanted a cup of tea.
GUS. He wanted a cup of tea! What about me? I've been wanting a cup of tea all night!
BEN (despairingly). What do we do now?
GUS. What are we supposed to drink?
BEN sits on his bed, staring.
What about us?
BEN sits.
I'm thirsty too. I'm starving. And he wants a cup of tea.
That beats the band, that does.
BEN lets his head sink on to his chest.
I could do with a bit of sustenance myself. What about you?
You look as if you could do with something too.
GUS sits on his bed.
We send him up all we've got and he's not satisfied. No, honest, it's enough to make the cat laugh. Why did you send him up all that stuff? (Thoughtfully.) Why did I send it up?
Pause.
Who knows what he's got upstairs? He's probably got a salad bowl. They must have something up there. They won't get much from down here. You notice they didn't ask for any salads? They've probably got a salad bowl up there. Cold meat, radishes, cucumbers. Watercress. Roll mops.
Pause.
Hardboiled eggs.
Pause.
The lot. They've probably got a crate of beer 00. Probably eating my crisps with a pint of beer now. Didn't have anything to say about those crisps, did he? They do all it, don't worry about that. You don't think they're just going to sit there and wait for stuff to come up from down here, do you? That'll get them nowhere.
Pause.
They do all right.
Pause.
And he wants a cup of tea.
Pause.
That's past a joke, in my opinion.
He looks over at BEN, rises, and goes to him.
What's the matter with you? You don't look too bright. I feel like an Alka-Seltzer myself.
BEN sits up.
BEN (in a low voice). Time's getting on.
GUS. I know. I don't like doing a job on an empty stomach.
BEN (wearily). Be quiet a minute. Let me give you your instruc-tions.
GUS. What for? We always do it the same way, don't we?
BEN. Let me give you your instructions.
GUS sighs and sits next to BEN on the bed. The instructions are stated and repeated automatically.
When we get the call, you go over and stand behind the door.
GUS. Stand behind the door.
BEN. If there's a knock on the door you don't answer it.
GUS. If there's a knock on the door I don't answer it.
BEN. But there won't be a knock on the door.
GUS. So I won't answer it.
BEN. When the bloke comes in - 
GUS. When the bloke comes in - BEN. Shut the door behind him.
GUS. Shut the door behind him.
BEN. Without divulging your presence.
GUS. Without divulging my presence.
BEN. He'll see me and come towards me.
GUS. He'll see you and come towards you.
BEN. He won't see you.
GUS (absently). Eh?
BEN. He won't see you.
GUS. He won't see me.
BEN. But he'll see me.
GUS. He'll see you.
BEN. He won't know you're there.
GUS. He won't know you're there.
BEN. He won't know you're there.
GUS. He won't know I'm there.
BEN. I take out my gun.
GUS. You take out your gun.
BEN. He stops in his tracks.
GUS. He stops in his tracks.
BEN. If he turns round - GUS. If he turns round - 
BEN. You're there.
GUS. I'm here.
BEN frowns and presses his forehead.
You've missed something out.
BEN. I know. What?
GUS. I haven't taken my gun out, according to you.
BEN. You take your gun out - GUS. After I've closed the door.
BEN. After you've closed the door.
Gus. You've never missed that out before, you know that?
BEN. When he sees you behind him - 
GUS. Me behind him -
BEN. And me in front of him - 
GUS. And you in front of him - BEN. He'll feel uncertain -
GUS. Uneasy.
BEN. He won't know what to do.
GUS. So what will he do?
BEN. He'll look at me and he'll look at you.
GUS. We won't say a word.
BEN. We'll look at him.
GUS. He won't say a word.
BEN. He'll look at us.
GUS. And we'll look at him.
BEN. Nobody says a word.
Pause.
GUS. What do we do if it's a girl?
BEN. We do the same.
GUS. Exactly the same?
BEN. Exactly.
Pause.
GUS. We don't do anything different?
BEN. We do exactly the same.
GUS. Oh.
GUS rises, and shivers.
Excuse me.
He exits through the door on the left. BEN remains sitting on the bed, still.
The lavatory chain is pulled once off left, but the lavatory does not flush.
Silence.
Gus re-enters and stops inside the door, deep in thought. He looks at BEN, then walks slowly across to his own bed. He is troubled. He stands, thinking. He turns and looks at BEN.
He moves a few paces towards him.
(Slowly in a low, tense voice.) Why did he send us matches if he knew there was no gas?
Silence.
BEN stares in front of him. Gus crosses to the left side of BEN, to the foot of his bed, to get to his other ear.
Ben. Why did he send us matches if he knew there was no gas?
BEN looks up.
Why did he do that?
BEN. Who?
GUS. Who sent us those matches?
BEN. What are you talking about?
GUS stares down at him.
GUS (thickly). Who is it upstairs?
BEN (nervously). What's one thing to do with another?
GUS. Who is it, though?
BEN. What's one thing to do with another?
BEN fumbles for his paper on the bed.
GUS. I asked you a question.
BEN. Enough!
GUS (with growing agitation). I asked you before. Who moved in? I asked you. You said the people who had it before moved out. Well, who moved in?
BEN (hunched). Shut up.
GUS. I told you, didn't I?
BEN (standing). Shut up!
GUS (feverishly), I told you before who owned this place, didn't I? I told you.
BEN hits him viciously on the shoulder.
I told you who ran this place, didn't I?
BEN hits him viciously on the shoulder.
(Violently.) Well, what's he playing all these games for?
That's what I want to know. What's he doing it for?
BEN. What games?
GUS (passionately, advancing). What's he doing it for? We've been through our tests, haven't we? We got right through our tests, years ago, didn't we? We took them together, don't you remember, didn't we? We've proved ourselves before now, haven't we? We've always done our job. What's he doing all this for? What's the idea? What's he playing these games for?
The box in the shaft comes down behind them. The noise is this time accompanied by a shrill whistle, as it falls. GUS rushes to the hatch and seizes the note.
(Reading.) Scampi!
He crumples the note, picks up the tube, takes out the whistle, blows and speaks.
WE'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT! NOTHING! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
BEN seizes the tube and flings GUS away. He follows GUS and slaps him hard, back-handed, across the chest.
BEN. Stop it! You maniac!
GUS. But you heard!
BEN (savagely). That's enough! I'm warning you!
Silence.
BEN hangs the tube. He goes to his bed and lies down. He picks up his paper and reads.
Silence.
The box goes up.
They turn quickly, their eyes meet. BEN turns to his paper.
Slowly GUS goes back to his bed, and sits.
Silence.
The hatch falls back into place.
They turn quickly, their eyes meet. BEN turns back 2o his paper.
Silence.
BEN throws his paper down.
BEN. Kaw!
He picks up the paper and looks at it.
Listen to this!
Pause.
What about that, eb?
Pause.
Kaw!
Pause.
Have you ever heard such a thing?
GUS (dully). Go on!
BEN. It's true.
GUS. Get away.
BEN. It's down here in black and white.
GUS (very Low). Is that a fact?
BEN. Can you imagine it.
GUS. It's unbelievable.
BEN. It's enough to make you want to puke, isn't it?
GUS (almost inaudible). Incredible.
BEN shakes his head. He puts the paper down and rises. He fixes the revolver in his holster.
GUS stands up. He goes towards the door on the left.
BEN. Where are you going?
GUS. I'm going to have a glass of water.
He exits. BEN brushes dust off his clothes and shoes. The whistle in the speaking-tube blows. He goes to it, takes the whistle out and puts the tube to his ear. He listens. He purs it to his mouth.
BEN. Yes.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Straight away. Right.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Sure we're ready.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Understood. Repeat. He has arrived and will be coming in straight away. The normal method to be employed. Under-stood.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Sure we're ready.
To ear. He listens. To mouth.
Right.
He hangs the tube up.
Gus!
He takes out a comb and combs his hair, adjusts his jacket to diminish the bulge of the revolver. The lavatory flushes off left. BEN goes quickly to the door, left.
Gus!
The door right opens sharply. BEN turns, his revolver levelled at the door.
Gus stumbles in.
He is stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie, holster and revolver.
He stops, body stooping, his arms at his sides.
He raises his head and looks at BEN.
A long silence.
They stare at each other.
