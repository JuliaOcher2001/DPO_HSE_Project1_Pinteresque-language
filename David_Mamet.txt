It's nice, the park is nice
EMIL. It's nice.
GEORGE. The park is nice.
EMIL. You forget.
GEORGE.... you remember.
EMIL. I don't know ...
GEORGE. What's to know? There's a boat!
EMIL. So early?
GEORGE. I suppose so ... because there it is.
EMIL. I wonder if it's cold out there.
GEORGE. There, here, it's like it is today. How it is today, that's how it is.
EMIL. But the boat is moving ...
GEORGE. So it's colder in relation how fast the boat is going.
EMIL. The water is colder than the land.
GEORGE. So it's cold in relation to the water.
EMIL. So it's a different temperature on the boat than on a bench.
GEORGE. They probably got sweaters.
EMIL. There's more than one in the boat?
GEORGE. Wait till they come round again.
EMIL. Where did they go?
GEORGE. Over there, behind the pier, where could they
EMIL. Not far ... it's expensive a boat.
GEORGE. They care?
EMIL. No.
GEORGE. If they got the money for a boat, they can afford it.
EMIL. It's not cheap.
GEORGE. I said it was cheap?
EMIL. Even a small boat.
GEORGE. I know it's not cheap.
EMIL. Even a very small boat is expensive.
GEORGE. Many times a small boat is even more expensive.
EMIL. Ah.
GEORGE. Depending ...
EMIL. Mmm.
GEORGE. On many factors.
EMIL. Mmm.
GEORGE.... the size of the boat...
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE.... the engine.
EMIL. Yes. The size of the engine.
GEORGE. Certainly, certainly.
EMIL. The speED.of the engine.
GEORGE. Many factors.
EMIL. The speED.of the boat.
GEORGE. That. None of it's cheap. It's all very intricate.
EMIL. Cars.
GEORGE. Boats, cars... air travel. The military. It was never cheap.
EMIL. Housing.
GEORGE. (looks) There's two of them in the boat.
EMIL. It's the same boat?
GEORGE. How many boats have we seen today?
EMIL. That's what I'm asking.
GEORGE. One.
EMIL. (looks) Another boat!
GEORGE. One, two ...
EMIL. A real clipper, too.
GEORGE. Where?
EMIL. Look at her will ya!
GEORGE. That?
EMIL. What else? Go, sister!
GEORGE. That?
EMIL. Sure as shootin'.
GEORGE. That's the water pump.
EMIL. That?
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. That?
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. The pump house?
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. She's the water pump?
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL.... look at her float.
GEORGE. Mmm.
EMIL. Look at her... just sit there.
GEORGE. Mmm.
EMIL. All year 'round.
GEORGE. I'll give you that.
EMIL. What a life.
GEORGE. Ducks!
EMIL. Where?
GEORGE. Where I'm pointing.
EMIL. Ahh.
GEORGE. A sure sign of spring.
EMIL. Autumn, too.
GEORGE. Uh huh.
EMIL.... you see them …
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. They go south..
GEORGE. Um.
EMIL. They come back..
GEORGE. Ummm.
EMIL. They live ...
GEORGE. They go ...
EMIL. Ahhh.
GEORGE. Ducks like to go …
EMIL.... yes?
GEORGE. Where it's nice …
EMIL. Ehhh?
GEORGE. At that time!
EMIL. Of course.
insorea And shey re a de so coey just go. So to cond
... a little too cold ...
EMIL. Like humans, they don't like cold.
GEORGE. And there they go.
EMIL. There they go.
GEORGE. And the same when it's warm.
EMIL. They come back.
GEORGE. They got a leader. A lead duck. He starts ... he's a duck. But he stays with the pack. Many times. He comes, he goes. He learns the route. Maybe he's got a little more on the ball.
EMIL. All this time there is another lead duck.
GEORGE. Of course. But he, he goes, he lives, maybe he finds a mate ...
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. And he waits... The lead duck... who knows?
EMIL. He dies.
GEORGE. One day, yes. He dies. He gets lost ...
EMIL. And our duck moves up.
GEORGE. He is now the leader. It is he who guides them from one home to the next. They all know the way. Each of them has it in him to know when the time is to move ... But he ... He will be in charge until ...
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. Just like the other one ...
EMIL. There's no shame in that.
GEORGE. Just like the previous duck ...
EMIL. It happenED.to him, it's got to happen to him.
GEORGE. The time comes to step down.
EMIL. He dies.
GEORGE. He dies, he leaves... something. And another duck moves on up.
EMIL. And someday.
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. Someone will take his place.
GEORGE. Until ...
EMIL. It's boring just to think about it.
GEORGE. You know, the duck's life is not all hearts and flowers. He's got his worries, too. He's got fleas and lice and diseases of the body. Delusions. Wing problems.
Sexual difficulties. Many things.
EMIL. It's not an easy life.
GEORGE. Only the beginning. The duck is at the mercy of any elements in the vicinity. Sunspots. Miscarriage.
Inappropriate changes in the weather.
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. Hunters. Blight. Tornadoes. Traps. Any number of airplanes.
EMIL. Small vicious children.
GEORGE. Chainstores. And, of course, the Blue Heron.
EMIL. Blue Heron?
GEORGE. The hereditary Enemy of the Duck.
EMIL. Yeah?
GEORGE. It's what they call symbiosis. They both live to insure the happiness of each other. The Blue Herons eat ducks, and the duck ...
EMIL. Yes?
GEORGE. The duck's pART.of the bargain...
EMIL. Is to be eaten by the Heron?
GEORGE. Is to . : • Well it slips me for the moment, but it's not as one-sidED.as it might appear. Nature has given the duck speED.and endurance and the ART.of concealment.
She has made the Heron large and unwieldy and blue to be able to spot at a distance. On the other hand he has the benefits of size and occasional camouflage should he come up against something blue.
EMIL. And shapED.like a bird.
GEORGE. Not always necessary. The battle between the two is as old as time. The ducks propagating, the Herons eating them. The Herons multiplying and losing great numbers to exhaustion in the never-ending chase of the duck. Each keeping the other in check, down through history, until a bond of unspoken friendship and respect unites them, even in the embrace of death.
EMIL. So why do they continue to fight?
GEORGE. Survival of the fittest. The never-ending struggle between heredity and environment. The urge to combat.
Old as the oceans. InstillED.in us all: Who can say to what purpose?
EMIL. Who?
GEORGE. We do not know. But this much we do know. As long as the duck exists, he will battle day and night, sick and well with the Heron, for so is it writ. And as long as the sky is made dark with the wing of the Monster Bird, the Heron will feast on duck.
EMIL. Also they got barnyard ducks.
GEORGE. Yeah. I know.
EMIL. That they raise for Easter and Thanksgiving.
GEORGE. You're thinking of Turkeys.
EMIL. Also ducks.
GEORGE. They keep 'em? In captivity?
EMIL. Yeah. In the Barnyard. They clip their wings.
GEORGE. Uh.
EMIL. Yeah. What? You can't put 'em on their honour?!
GEORGE. Times have changed.
EMIL. Vandalism... they fat 'em up. They feED.'em, the farmers, on special mixtures. Corn, and maybe an oat.
And they got special injections they give 'em. To keep 'em happy.
GEORGE. And they can't fly.
EMIL. No.
GEORGE. All with wildness is gone.
EMIL. Just walking around the farm all day. Eating.
GEORGE. They're allowED.to mate?
EMIL. This we do not know.
GEORGE. Eh?
EMIL. Only a few farmers know this.
GEORGE. Yeah?
EMIL. The mating of ducks is a private matter between the duck in question and his mate.
GEORGE. Yeah?
EMIL. It is a thing which few White men have witnessED.... And those who claim to have seen it ... strangely do not wish to speak.
GEORGE. There are things we're better off not to know.
EMIL. If you don't know, you never can be forcED.to tell.
GEORGE. They don't got those beaks for nothing.
EMIL. Nothing is for Nothing.
GEORGE. Too true.
EMIL. Everything has got a purpose.
GEORGE. True.
EMIL. Every blessED.thing ..
GEORGE. Oh yes.
EMIL. ... that lives has got a purpose.
GEORGE. Ducks ...
EMIL. Sweat glands ...
GEORGE. Yeah.
EMIL. We don't sweat for nothing, you know.
GEORGE. I know it.
EMIL. Everything that lives must sweat.
GEORGE. It's all got a purpose.
EMIL. It's all got a rhyme and a reason.
GEORGE. The purpose of sweat is, in itself, not clear.
EMIL. Yes...
GEORGE. But .., there it is.
EMIL. A purpose and a reason. Even those we, at this time, do not clearly understand.
GEORGE. Sure as shootin'.
EMIL. The yearly migration of the duck, to mate and take
a little rest ...
GEORGE. Purpose.
EMIL. Sweat ...
GEORGE. Purpose.
EMIL. There's nothing you could possibly name that doesn't have a purpose. Don't even bother to try. Don't waste your time.
GEORGE. I'm in no hurry.
EMIL. It's all got a purpose. The very fact that you are sitting here right now on this bench has got a purpose.
GEORGE. And so, by process of elimination, does the bench.
EMIL. Now you're talking sense.
GEORGE. Darn Tootin'.
EMIL. The law of the universe is a law unto itself.
GEORGE. Yes. Yes.
EMIL. And woe be to the man who fools around.
GEORGE. You can't get away with nothing.
EMIL. And if you could it would have a purpose.
GEORGE. Nobody knows that better than me.
EMIL. ... Well put.
GEORGE. Sure as shootin'.
EMIL. The yearly migration of the duck, to mate and take
a little rest ...
GEORGE. Purpose.
EMIL. Sweat ...
GEORGE. Purpose.
EMIL. There's nothing you could possibly name that doesn't have a purpose. Don't even bother to try. Don't waste your time.
GEORGE. I'm in no hurry.
EMIL. It's all got a purpose. The very fact that you are sitting here right now on this bench has got a purpose.
GEORGE. And so, by process of elimination, does the bench.
EMIL. Now you're talking sense.
GEORGE. Darn Tootin'.
EMIL. The law of the universe is a law unto itself.
GEORGE. Yes. Yes.
EMIL. And woe be to the man who fools around.
GEORGE. You can't get away with nothing.
EMIL. And if you could it would have a purpose.
GEORGE. Nobody knows that better than me.
EMIL. ... Well put.
GEORGE. But I think ...
EMIL. It's possible you misread the ...
GEORGE. Possibly, but. •
EMIL. No, no. No. I must still stick to my saying no. No.
GEORGE.
Perhaps I misread it. What a thing, however.
To be able to fly. In later life.
EMIL. Swimming ain't so bad either.
GEORGE. But any fool who knows how to swim can swim.
It takes a bird to Fly.
EMIL. Insects also fly.
GEORGE. But not in the same category.
EMIL. Insects... birds and insects and ... I could be wrong but ..
GEORGE. You are wrong. Nothing else flies.
FIFTH VARIATION
Did you know what I was reading?
GEORGE. Did you know what I was reading somewhere?
EMIL. Don't start.
GEORGE. About the stratosphere. The stratosphere, particularly the lower stratosphere, is becoming messy with gook.
EMIL. Eh?
GEORGE. According to the weatherman.
EMIL. Our stratosphere?
GEORGE. Everybody's. Because it's all the same thing.
EMIL. Eh?
GEORGE. As if you drop a pebble in a pond and the ripples spread you-know-not-where ..
EMIL. Yes?
GEORGE. So, when you stick shit up in the Stratosphere ...
EMIL. Yes?
GEORGE. You got the same problem.
EMIL. What kind of gook?
GEORGE. All kinds. Dirt…
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. Gook...
EMIL. No good.
GEORGE. Automotive…
EMIL. Yeah.
GEORGE. Cigarette smoke. It's all up there. It's not going anywhere.
EMIL. Yeah.
GEORGE. They're finding out many things about the world we live in from the air.
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. For, in many ways ... the air is more a pART.of our world than we would like to admit. Think about it.
EMIL. I will.
GEORGE. Planes that come down, they got to wash 'em right away. They go up clean, they come down filthy.
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. But the creatures with no choice: Insects, ducks.
EMIL. Gliders.
GEORGE. It's a shame. They should be shot.
EMIL. Some of them are shot.
GEORGE. No, them, the ones responsible. Ducks! They're finding ducks with lung cancer. I was reading about this hunter in the forest and he shot a bunch of ducks that were laying down.. • EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. And he missed. But! As he was walking away he heard this hacking, and he went back to investigate. And there were these five or six stuntED.ducks sitting in a clearing, hacking their guts out.
EMIL. No!
GEORGE. Coughing and sneezing. Runny noses ... and they'd flap their wings and go maybe two flaps and fall down coughing.
EMIL. It's no good for you.
GEORGE. And he says instead of running off they came up and huddlED.around his feet with these rheumy, runny eyes. Looking quite pathetic. And he says he couldn't get it out of his mind ...
EMIL. What?
GEORGE. I'd feel silly to say it.
EMIL. Tell me.
GEORGE. That they lookED.like they were trying to bum a smoke.
EMIL. ... That's ridiculous.
GEORGE. I know it.
EMIL. I think someone is putting you on.
GEORGE. Very likely.
GEORGE. What kind of a world is it that can't even keep its streets clean?
EMIL. A self-destructive world.
GEORGE. You said it.
EMIL. A cruel world.
GEORGE. A dirty world. Feh. I'm getting old.
EMIL. Nobody's getting any younger.
GEORGE. Almost makes a feller want to stop trying.
EMIL. Stop trying what?
GEORGE. You know, life is a lot simpler than many people would like us to believe.
EMIL. How so?
GEORGE. Take the duck.
EMIL. All right.
GEORGE. Of what does his life consist?
EMIL. Well, flying ...
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. Eating.
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. Sleeping.
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. Washing himself
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. Mating.
GEORGE. Yes.
EMIL. And perhaps getting himself shot by some jerk in a
rED.hat.
GEORGE. Or 'Death.'
EMIL. Should we include that as one of the activities of life?
GEORGE. Well, you can't die in a vacuum.
EMIL. That's true.
GEORGE. So there we have it: the duck, too, is doomED.to death…
EMIL. As are we all.
GEORGE. But his life prior to that point is so much more simple. He is born. He learns his trade: to fly. He flies, he eats, he finds a mate, he has young, he flies some more, he dies. A simple, straight-forward easy-to-handle life.
EMIL. So what's your point?
GEORGE. Well, lookit:
EMIL. Okay.
GEORGE. On his deathbED.what does the duck say if only he could speak?
EMIL. He wants to live some more.
GEORGE. Right. But remorse? Guilt? Other bad feelings?
No. No. He is in tune with nature.
EMIL. He is pART.of nature. He is a duck.
GEORGE. Yes, but so is man a pART.of nature.
EMIL. Speak for yourself.
GEORGE. I am speaking for myself.
EMIL. Then speak to yourself.
GEORGE. Who askED.you to listen?
EMIL. Who askED.you to talk?
GEORGE. Why are you getting upset?
EMIL. You upset me.
GEORGE. Yeah?
EMIL. With your talk of nature and the duck and death.
Morbid useless talk. You know, it is a good thing to be perceptive, but you shouldn't let it get in the way.
GEORGE. And that is the point I was trying to make.
SEVENTH VARIATION
Yes, in many ways
GEORGE. Yes, in many ways Nature is our window to the world.
EMIL. Nature is the world.
GEORGE. Which shows you how easy it is to take a good idea and glop it up.
EMIL. So who do you complain to.
GEORGE. Well, you complain to me.
EMIL. Do you mind?
GEORGE. I'm glad I got the time to listen.
EMIL. A man needs a friend in this life.
GEORGE. In this or any other life.
EMIL. You said it. Without a friend, life is not ...
GEORGE. Worth living?
EMIL. No it's still worth living. I mean, what is worth living if not life? No. But life without a friend is ...
GEORGE. It's lonely.
EMIL. It sure is. You said it. It's good to have a friend.
GEORGE. It's good to be a friend.
EMIL. It's good to have a friend to talk to.
GEORGE. It's good to talk to a friend.
EMIL. To complain to a friend GEORGE. It's good to listen ..
EMIL. Is good.
GEORGE. To a friend.
EMIL. To make life a little less full of pain ...
GEORGE. I'd try anything.
EMIL. Is good.
GEORGE. For you, or for a friend. Because it's good to help.
EMIL. To help a friend in neED.is the most that any man can want to do.
GEORGE. And you couldn't ask for more than that.
EMIL. I wouldn't.
GEORGE. Good.
EMIL. Being a loner in this world ...
GEORGE. Is not my bag of tea.
EMIL. Is no good. No man is an Island to himself.
GEORGE. Or to anyone else.
EMIL. You can't live alone forever. You can't live forever anyway. But you can't live alone. Nothing that lives can live alone. Flowers. You never find just one flower. Trees.
Ducks.
GEORGE. Cactus.
EMIL. Lives alone?
GEORGE. Well, you take the cactus in the waste. It stands alone as far as the eye can tell.
EMIL. But there are other cacti.
GEORGE. Not in that immediate area, no.
EMIL. What are you trying to say?
GEORGE. That the cactus, unlike everything else that cannot live alone, thrives ...
EMIL. I don't want to hear it.
GEORGE. But it's true, the cactus.
EMIL. I don't want to hear it. If it's false, don't waste my time and if it is true I don't want to know.
GEORGE. It's a proven fact.
EMIL. I can't hear you.
GEORGE. Even the duck sometimes.
EMIL. (looks) ... Nothing that lives can live alone.
EIGHTH VARIATION
Ahh, I don't know
EMIL. Ahh, I don't know.
GEORGE. So what?
EMIL. You gotta point... Sometimes I think the park is more trouble than it's worth.
GEORGE. How so?
EMIL. To come and look at the lake and the trees and animals and sun just once in a while and traipse back.
Back to ...
GEORGE. Your apartment.
EMIL. Joyless. Cold concrete. Apartment. Stuff. Linoleum.
Imitation.
GEORGE. The park is more real?
EMIL. The Park? Yes.
GEORGE. Sitting on benches.
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. Visiting tame animals?
EMIL. Taken from wildest captivity.
GEORGE. Watching a lake that's a sewer?
EMIL. At least it's water.
GEORGE. You wanna drink it?
EMIL. I drink it every day.
GEORGE. Yeah. After it's been purED.and filtered.
EMIL. A lake just the same. My inland sea.
GEORGE. Fulla inland shit.
EMIL. It's better than nothing. Well, it's a close second.
GEORGE. But why does it hurt you to come to the park?
EMIL. I sit home, I can come to the park. At the park the only place I have to go is home.
GEORGE. Better not to have a park?
EMIL. I don't know.
GEORGE. Better not to have a Zoo? We should forget what a turtle is?
EMIL. Aaaaah.
GEORGE. Our children should never know the joy of watching some animal... behaving?
EMIL. I don't know.
GEORGE. They should stay home and know only guppies eating their young.
EMIL.
Let 'em go to the country.
Nature's playground.
The country.
The land that time forgot.
Mallards in formation.
Individual barnyard noises.
Horses.
Rusty gates.
An ancient tractor.
Hay, barley.
Mushrooms.
Rye.
StuffED.full of abundance.
Enough to teED.the nations of the World.
GEORGE. We'll have 'em over. We don't get enough riff-raff.
EMIL. Enough to gorge the countless cows of South America.
GEORGE. Did you make that up?
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. I take my hat off to you.
EMIL. Thank you.
GEORGE. 'FeED.the many' ... how does it go?
EMIL. Um. Stuff the nameless ... It'll come to me.
GEORGE. When you get it, tell me.
EMIL. At the Zoo they got ducks. They got. What do you call it?.. A Mallard. They got a mallard and a ... what is it? A cantaloupe.
GEORGE. You mean an antelope.
EMIL. No... no, it's not cantaloupe. But it's like cantaloupe. Uh ...
GEORGE. Antelope?
EMIL. No! Antelope is like an elk. What I'm thinking is like a duck.
GEORGE. Goose?
EMIL. No. But it's ... What sounds like cantaloupe, but it isn't.
GEORGE. ... Antelope. I'm sorry, but that's it.
EMIL. No. Wait! Wait. Ca... cala ... camma...
grantal…
GEORGE. Canadian ducks?
EMIL. No! I've seen 'em, the ones I mean. I've seen 'em in the Zoo.
GEORGE. Ducks?
EMIL. Yes! Ducks that I'm talking about. By God, I know what I mean... They're called... The only thing that comes up is canta. Pantel. Pandel. Panda...
Candarolpe ...
GEORGE. They ain't got no panda.
EMIL. I know it ... Panna …
GEORGE. They had a panda at the other Zoo but it died.
EMIL. Yeah. Nanna…
GEORGE. There were two of 'em. Or three. But they were all men and when they died... they couldn't have any babies, of course…
EMIL. Randspan?
GEORGE.... so the Pandas ...
EMIL.... lope ...
GEORGE. Died.
EMIL. Lo... lopa? Loola… 
GEORGE. Not Swans?
EMIL. No. Please. I know Swans. I'm talking about ducks.
GEORGE. I know it.
EMIL. Can ...
GEORGE. Those Pandas were something.
EMIL. Yeah.
GEORGE. Giant Pandas.
EMIL. Yeah.
GEORGE. Big things.
EMIL. I've seen 'em.
GEORGE. Not lately you haven't.
EMIL. No.
GEORGE. Cause they been dead.
EMIL. I know it.
GEORGE. From the Orient. Pandas from the Far East.
There for all to see.
EMIL. Mantalope?
GEORGE. Black and White.
EMIL. Palapope…
GEORGE. Together.
EMIL. Maaaa ..•
GEORGE. The Giant Panda.
EMIL. Fanna ...
GEORGE. Over two stories tall.
EMIL. Raaa?
GEORGE. It got too expensive to feED.it. They had to put
'em to sleep.
TENTH VARIATION
It's a crying shame
EMIL. It's a crying shame.
GEORGE. Eh?
EMIL. A crying piss-laden shame. A blot on our time.
Gook on the scutcheon. Oil slicks from here to Africa.
GEORGE. Huh?
EMIL. They don't allow no smoking on ocean liners. One spark overboard and the whole ocean goes.
GEORGE. Yeah?
EMIL. Oil-bearing ducks floating up dead on the beaches.
Beaches closing. No place to swim. The surface of the sea is solid dying wildlife. In Australia... they're finding fish, they're going blind from lack of sun. New scary species are developing. They eat nothing but dead birds.
GEORGE. Yeah?
EMIL. Catfish.
GEORGE. ... I think that's something different.
EMIL. Nevermore. Thrushes. No more the duck. Blue-jays.
Cardinals. Making the dead ocean their last home.
GEORGE. When I was young ...
EMIL. Floating up dead on the beaches.
GEORGE. Around my house…
EMIL. Their lungs a sodden pulp of gasoline. They're made for something better than that.
GEORGE. In the springtime we usED.to ...
EMIL. Can't even burn leaves in the fall. We have to wrap them in Plastic. Next we'll have to wrap each leaf individually. Little envelopes for each leaf, it shouldn't contaminate us with the vapours. Little numberED.packets.
GEORGE. Our lawn was.
EMIL. What?
GEORGE. Eh?
EMIL. What was your lawn?
GEORGE. I forget.
EMIL. Can you imagine, being the last man alive to have seen a blue heron? Or a wild buffalo?
GEORGE. No man can live in the path of a wild buffalo.
EMIL. All right. A regular buffalo, then.
GEORGE. They got 'em at the zoo.
EMIL. Buffaloes?
GEORGE. Yeah, they got plenty of 'em.
EMIL. But that's in captivity.
GEORGE. I should hope so.
EMIL. Well, in any case, you see my point.
GEORGE. Yes...
EMIL. Well, that's the point I was trying to make.
GEORGE. You know, I remember reading somewhere ..
EMIL. Please.


GEORGE. All right.




EMIL. I hurt your feelings.
GEORGE. Yes.


EMIL. I'm sorry.


GEORGE. I know.




EMIL. There is no excuse for that.
GEORGE. It's all right.




EMIL. What were you gonna say?


GEORGE. About the balance of nature.
EMIL. Yes?


Spectator Sports.
GEORGE. Being dependent on one of the Professional
EMIL. You're fulla shit.




GEORGE. For its continuation.


EMIL. What made you think of that?
GEORGE. I'm not sure.


EMIL. Some sport?


GEORGE. I don't know.


EMIL. Nature?


GEORGE. Perhaps.




EMIL. Do you remember which sport?
GEORGE. I... no, I wouldn't want to go on record as
remembering. One of the Major League sports.
EMIL. Where did you read it?
GEORGE. I don't know. The Readers' Digest ...
EMIL. Eh?
GEORGE. Also they've found a use for cancer.
EMIL. Knock wood.
GEORGE. It's about time. All the millions we spend on research, cigarettes ...
EMIL. Wildlife.
GEORGE. Nothing wrong with spending money on Wildlife.
EMIL. It's all take, take, take.
GEORGE. Nature gives it back many times over.
EMIL. Yeah?
GEORGE. A blue heron at sunset.
EMIL. They're all dead…
GEORGE. A whiff of breeze from the lake ...
EMIL. ... or hiding.
GEORGE. A flight of Ducks.
EMIL. The duck is, after all, only a bird.
GEORGE. But what a bird.
EMIL. A pigeon, too, is a bird.
GEORGE. There's no comparison.
EMIL. What is the difference between a duck and a pigeon?
GEORGE. Basically, a lack of comparison.
EMIL. Aside from that?
GEORGE. It is a difference of.. self-respect. You can't argue with that,
EMIL. I won't begin.
GEORGE. It wouldn't get you anywhere.
EMIL. Ha. Ha.
GEORGE. Big talk.
EMIL. I'm ready to back it up.
GEORGE. Oh yeah?
EMIL. Yeah.
GEORGE. All right.
EMIL.... anytime you're ready.
GEORGE. I'm ready.
EMIL. All right, then.
GEORGE. Are you ready?
EMIL. You betcha, RED.Ryder.
GEORGE. Good.
EMIL.. Hey! What? Grownups squabbling about birds?
GEORGE. You startED.it.
EMIL. I beg to differ.
GEORGE. Go right ahead.
EMIL. All right, I do differ.
GEORGE. It makes no difference. I was holding an intelligent conversation and then you came along...
EMIL. And simply pointED.out that you were turning something into a thing which it is not.
GEORGE. What is more noble than a duck.
EMIL. Depends on the duck.
GEORGE. Is a pigeon more noble than a duck.
EMIL. Are you saying that just because the duck is wild and has no rules…
GEORGE. No rules? No rules? No rules but the sun and the moon! No rules but the law of the seasons and when to go where at what specific time? No rules but to find a mate and cleave into her until death does him part?
EMIL. Is that true?
GEORGE. It surely is.
EMIL. That I didn't know.
GEORGE. Well, learn from your mistakes.
EMIL. I will.
GEORGE. No rules!

EMIL. Pish foo.
GEORGE. The French, for example.
EMIL. Are modellED.on animals?
GEORGE. Historically, yes.
EMIL. Where did you get that?

EMIL. Another countless danger for the duck.
GEORGE. Frost, too.
EMIL. Hail.
GEORGE. Uh.
EMIL. Can you imagine it?

GEORGE. Nowhere to go.
EMIL. Hail all over. Hitting him. Pelting him. Making ribbons of his wings. Creaming him out of the sky.
GEORGE. The Law of Life.
EMIL. That's what you say now.
GEORGE. Some must die so others can live.
EMIL. But they must die, too.
GEORGE. So some must die so others can live a little longer. That's implied.

GEORGE. Of course. So that others can live. It makes sense if you think about it.
THIRTEENTH VARIATION

EMIL. No.
GEORGE. A LOT of luck.
EMIL. And practice.
GEORGE. Who's got the time?
EMIL. Every day. A half hour anyway. Practising ...
GEORGE.. is where they separate the men from the boys. At that moment there is no turning back. You're committed. You've been blatting around and searching the sky and crouching 'till your back hurts. From dawn on.
EMIL. Yes.
GEORGE. Lying on the cold Earth, trying not to look like anything. Hoping. Praying for that ONE DUCK ...
EMIL. A low flying duck . ..
GEORGE. That one chance to show what dreams are made of. Until ...
EMIL. Yes?
GEORGE. Until ... off in the distance. Beyond the horizon
"til you don't even know what it is, is a honking. The honking comes closer. Closer and louder. You see a far-off blur. The blur becomes a speck. The speck gets bigger.
It's a big speck. It's a dot. The dot is advancing and it's honking and the honking is louder and becomes clear and precise. You can just make it out. Flapping. Flying straight in a line to join its comrades. Frantic. Lost.
Dangerous. Vicious: A DUCK. ... and on he comes. You quietly raise from the ground. One knee... two knees.
You lift the gun, you put the gun on your shoulder and point it at the duck. It's you and him. You and the duck on the marsh. He wants to go home and you want to kill him for it. So you fire the gun. Once, again. Again. Again.
Your ears are ringing. Your eyes are coverED.in spots. You cannot see. You are quivering and you gotta sit down.
Your heART.is going fast ...
EMIL. Where's the duck?

DANNY. Up in her room?
BERNIE. Yeah.
DANNY. Was she a pro?
BERNIE. At that age?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. Well, at this point we don't know. So anyway, I go over and ask her can I front her for the smokes, and she says she couldn't, and then she says Well, all right, and would I like to join her in a cup of coffee.
DANNY. She askED.you ...
BERNIE. ... yeah.
DANNY. For a cup of coffee?
BERNIE. Right?
DANNY. And all this time she was nineteen?

BERNIE. Yeah.
DANNY. You're shitting me.
BERNIE. I'm telling you.
DANNY. And was she a pro?
BERNIE. So at this point, we don't know. Pro, semi-pro, Betty CoED.from College, regular young broad, it's anybody's ballgame. So, anyway, up we go. Fifth floor on the alley and it's Sit down, you wanna drink?" 'What you got?", 'Bourbon," 'Fine.' And goddam if she doesn't lay half a rock on me for the cigarettes.
DANNY. No.
BERNIE. Yeah.
DANNY. So this changes the complexity of things.

BERNIE. Yes, And (b) she says 'And then let's fuck?' DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. What did I just tell you?
DANNY. She said that?
BERNIE. I hope to tell you.
DANNY.
Nineteen years old?
BERNIE. Nineteen, twenty.
DANNY. And was she a pro?
BERNIE. So at this point I don't know. But I do say I'll join her in the shower, if she has no objections.
DANNY. Of course.
BERNIE. So into the old shower. And does this broad have a body?
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. Are you kidding me?
DANNY. So tell me.
BERNIE. The tits…
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. The legs…

BERNIE. Are you fucking fooling me? The ass on this broad…
DANNY. Young ass, huh?
BERNIE. Well yeah, young broad, young ass.
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. And lathering her ...
DANNY. Mmmm.
BERNIE. And drop the soap…This, that, and we get out. Towelling off, each of us in his or her full glory. So while we’re rowelling off, I flick the towel at her, very playfully and by accident it catches her a good one on the ass, and thwack, a big rED.mark.
DANNY. No.
Benie of alias aED.so prise wheele this
would fucking kill a horse.
DANNY. Huh?
BERNIE. So what the hell, I'm liberal.
DANNY. If that's her act, that's her act.
BERNIE. Goes without saying. So I look around, figuring to follow in my footsteps, and what is handy but this little G.E. clock radio. So I pick the mother up and heave it at her. Catches her across the shoulder blades, and we've got this long welt.
DANNY. Draw blood?
BERNIE. At this point, no. So what does she do? She says
'wait a minute,'
and she crawls under the bed. From
under the bED.she pulls this suitcase, and from out of the suitcase comes this World War II Flak Suit.
DANNY. They're hard to find.
BERNIE. Zip, zip, zip, and she gets into the Flak Suit and we get down on the bed.
DANNY. What are you doing?
BERNIE. Fucking.
DANNY. She's in the Flak Suit?
BERNIE. Right.
DANNY. How do you get in?
open.
BERNIE. How do you think I get in? She leaves the zipper
DANNY. That's what I thought.
BERNIE. But the shot is, while we're fucking, she wants me, every thirty seconds or so, to go BOOM at the top of my lungs.
DANNY. At her?
BERNIE. No, just in general. So we're humping and bumping and greasing the old Flak Suit and every once in a while I go BOOM, and she starts in on me. Turn me over, she says, so I do. She's on her stomach. I'm on
top ..•
DANNY. They got a flap in the back of the Flak Suit?
BERNIE. Yes. So she's on her stomach, etcetera. In the middle of everything she slithers over to the side of the bid, picks up the house phone and says, 'Give me Room DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. 'Who are you calling?" I say. 'A friend,' she says.
So okay. They answer the phone. 'Patrice,' she says, 'It's he Coup here with a found, and I could us a little DANNY. Ah ha!
BERNIE. So wait. So I don't know what the shot is. So all of a sudden I hear coming out of the phone: 'Rat Tat Tat Tat Tat. Ka POW! AK AK AK AK AK AK AK Ка
Pow!' So fine. I'm pumping away, the chick on the other end is making airplane noises, every once in a while I go BOOM, and the broad on the bED.starts going crazy.
She's moaning and groaning and about to go the whole long route. Humping and bumping, and she's screaming
'RED.dog One to RED.dog Squadron'
... all of a sudden
she screams 'Wait? She wriggles out, leans under the bed, and she pulls out this five-gallon jerrycan.
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. Opens it up ... it's full of gasoline. So she splashes the mother all over the walls, whips a fuckin'
Zippo out of the Flak suit, and WHOOSH, the whole room is in flames. So the whole fuckin' joint is going up in smoke, the telephone is going 'Rat Tat Tat,' the broad jumps back on the bED.and yells 'Now, give it to me now for the love of Christ.' (Pause.) So I look at the broad... and I figure... fuck this nonsense. I grab my clothes, I peel a saw-buck off my wad, as I make the door I fling it at her. 'For cab fare,' I yell. She doesn't hear nothing.
One, two, six, I'm in the hall. Struggling into my shorts and hustling for the elevator. Whole fucking hall is full of smoke, above the flames I just make out my broad, she's singing 'Off we go into the Wild Blue Yonder,' and the elevator arrives, and the whole fucking hall is full of firemen. (Pause.) Those fucking firemen make out like bandits. (Pause.)
DANNY. Nobody does it normally anymore.
BERNIE. It's these young broads. They don't know what the fuck they want.
DANNY. You think she was a pro?
BERNIE. A pro, Dan DANNY. Yes.
BERNIE.. is how you think about yourself. You see my point?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. Well, all right, then. I'll tell you one thing... she knew all the pro moves.
JOAN. and Deb at the apartment that they share. JOAN. is getting ready to go out.
JOAN. Men.
DEBORAH. Yup.
JOAN. They're all after only one thing.
DEBORAH. Yes. I know. (Pause.)
JOAN.
But it's never the same thing.
JOAN. is at a singles bar sealED.alone. Bernard spots her and moves to her table.
BERNIE. Evening. Good evening.
JOAN. Good evening.
BERNIE. How would you like some company. (Pause.)
What if I was to sit down here? What would that do for you, huh?
JOAN. No, I don't think so, no.
Pause.
Is there something I can do for you?
BERNIE. Nope. Not a thing in the world, no. I'm just standing here, looking for some place to sit down, huh?
(Pause.)
Sits down at her table.
Well, is it a free country, or what?
JOAN. Don't torture me, just let me hear it, okay?
BERNIE. (pause) So here I am. I'm just in town for a one-day layover and I happen to find myself in this bar. So, so far so good. What am I going to do? I could lounge alone and lonely and stare into my drink, or I could take the bull by the horns and make an effort to enjoy myself...
JOAN. Are you making this up?
BERNIE. So hold on. So I see you seatED.at this table and I say to myself, 'Doug McKenzie, there is a young woman,' I say to myself, 'What is she doing here?", and I think she is here for the same reasons as I. To enjoy herself, and perhaps, to meet provocative people. (Pause.) I'm a meteorologist for TWA. It's an incredibly interesting, but lonely job... Stuck in the cockpit of some jumbo jet hours at a time... nothing to look at but charts ...
What are you drinking?
JOAN. Scotch on the rocks.
BERNIE. You're a scotch drinker, huh?
JOAN. Yes.
BERNIE. Well, what the hell, you're drinking scotch. But I say 'Why pigeonhole ourselves?' A person makes an effort to enjoy himself, why pin a label on it, huh? This is life.
You learn a lot about life working for the airlines. Because you're constantly in touch (you know with what?) with the idea of Death. (Pause.) Not that I'm a fan of morbidness, and so on. I mean. To meet interesting new people or not.
(Pause.) What else is there?
JOAN. Can I tell you something?
BERNIE. You bet.
JOAN. Forgive me if I'm being too personal... but I do not find you sexually attractive. (Pause.)
BERNIE. What is that, some new kind of line? Huh? I mean, not that I mind what you think, if that's what you think ... but ... that's a fucking rotten thing to say.
JOAN. I'll live.
BERNIE. All kidding aside... lookit, I'm a fucking professional, huh? My life is a bunch of having to make split-second decisions. Life or death fucking decisions. So that's what it is, so okay. I work hard, I play hard. Comes I got a day off I wanna relax a bit... I wander - quite by accident - into this bar. I have a drink or two. perhaps a drop too much. Perhaps I get too loose (it's been known to happen). So what do I see? A nice young woman sitting by herself...
JOAN. We've done this one.
BERNIE. So just who the fuck do you think you are, God's gift to Women? I mean where do you fucking get off with his shit. You don't want to get come on to, go enroll in a convent. You think I don't have better things to do? I don't have better ways to spend my off hours than to listen to some nowhere cunt try out cute bits on me? I mean why don't you just clean your fucking act up, Missy.
You're living in a city in 1976. (Pause.) Am I getting through to you?
JOAN. I think I'd like to be left alone.
BERNIE. Ah, you're breaking my heart. My fucking heART.is pumping pisswater for you. You're torturing me with your pain and aloofness. You know that?
JOAN. I'm terribly sorry.
BERNIE. Sorry don't mean shit. You're a grown woman, behave like it for chrissakes. Huh? I mean, what the fuck do you think society is, just a bunch of rules strung together for your personal pleasure?
JOAN. Sometimes I think I'm not a very nice person.
BERNIE. You flatter yourself. (JOAN. rises.) So where are you going now?
JOAN. My little boy is sick, and I really should be getting home.
BERNIE. Cockteaser.
JOAN. I beg your pardon?
BERNIE. You heard me.
JOAN. I have never been callED.that in my life.
BERNIE. Well, you just lost your cherry.
JOAN. I ... I find that very insulting.
BERNIE. Go get a lawyer, bitch. Go get a writ, you got yourself a case.
Pause.
JOAN. (sits down again) I... I'm... I'm sorry if I was being rude to you.
BERNIE. Oh, you're sorry if you were being rude to me.
JOAN. Yes.
BERNIE. You got a lot of fuckin' nerve. (Rises, calls for check, goes.)
At work. Dan and Bernard are al work. They are filing.
BERNIE. The main thing, Dan ...

DANNY. Yeah ...
BERNIE. ... and Two: Nothing… nothing makes you so
attractive to the opposite sex as getting your rocks off on a regular basis.
The library. Deb is seated, working. Dan cruises her and so on.
DANNY. Hi.
DEBORAH. Hello.
DANNY. I saw you at the ART.Institute.
DEBORAH. Uh huh.
DANNY. I rememberED.your hair.
DEBORAH. Hair memory.

DEBORAH. You mean a man?
DANNY. Yes, a man.
DEBORAH. I'm a Lesbian. (Pause.)
DANNY. As a physical preference, or from political beliefs?
Bernard's apartment. Bernard is seatED.in front of the television at three in the morning.
TV When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are. If, on the other hand, you apply for a personal loan, all sorts of circumstantial evidence is required. I wonder if any mathematician has done serious research on the efficacity of prayer. For example: you're walking down the street thinking 'God, if I don't get laid tonight, I don't know what all!' (A common form of prayer) And all of a sudden, WHAM! (Pause.) Perhaps you do get laid, or perhaps you get hit by a cab, or perhaps you meet the man or woman of your persuasion. But the prayer is utterED.- yes it is - solely as a lamentation, and with no real belief in its causal properties.
When you don't get laid, tomorrow's prayer has the extra addED.oomph of involuntary continence. But if you do get laid - think on that a moment, will you? If you do manage to mo, du the old wir, how many people would stapor?
Dan and Deb are in bED.at his apartment.
DANNY. Well.
DEBORAH. Well.
Dause) Youh, well, hey... uh.. (Pause.) I feel great.
DEBORAH. Uh huh.
Dau Yup. (Pause.) You, uh, you have to go to work (you work. right?) (Deb nods.) you have to go to work tomorrow?
DEBORAH. Yes, well ...
DANNY. You're going home?
DEBORAH. Do you want me to?
DANNY. Only if you want to. Do you want to?
DEBORAH. Do you want me to stay? I don't know if it's such a good idea that I stay here tonight.
DANNY. Why? (Pause.) I'd like you to stay. If you'd like to.
Deb nods.
DANNY. Well, then, all right, then. Huh? (Pause.)
DEBORAH. I like your apartment.
DANNY. Yeah? I'm glad.
DEBORAH. I like it here.
DANNY. So, look, so tell me. How would you like to eat dinner with me tomorrow. If you're not doing anything. If you're not too busy. If you're busy it's not important.
DEBORAH. I'd love to eat dinner with you tomorrow.
DANNY. You would, huh?
DEBORAH. Yes.
DANNY. Well, okay, that's nice. That's very nice. I'm going to look forward to that.
DEBORAH. I could come over here and cook.
DANNY. You could.
DEBORAH. Yes.
DANNY. You could come over here and cook dinner, you'd like to do that?
DEBORAH. Yes.
DANNY. We could do that ...
DEBORAH. Sure.
DANNY. Yeah. We could do that. (Pause.) Let's do that.
DEBORAH. Okay. (Pause.) I'm not really a Lesbian.
DANNY. No?
DEBORAH. But I have had some Lesbianic experiences.
DANNY. What, like going to bED.with other women?
DEBORAH. ... and I enjoyED.them.
DANNY. (pause) Well, sure. (Pause.) You going to sleep?
DEBORAH. (sleepily) Yes.
DANNY. (pause) You having a good time?
DEBORAH. (sleeping) Yes.
DANNY. That's good. (Pause.) Goodnight.
DEBORAH. Goodnight.
Pause.
DANNY. See you in the morning.
The next moming. Deb and JOAN. al their apartment. Deb enters.
JOAN. So what's he like?
DEBORAH. Who?
JOAN. Whoever you haven't been home, I haven't seen you in two days that you've been seeing.
DEBORAH. Did you miss me?
JOAN. No. Your plants died. (Pause.) I'm kidding. What's
his name.
DEBORAH. DANNY..
JOAN. What's he do?
DEBORAH. He works in the Loop.
JOAN. How wonderful for him.
DEBORAH. He's an Assistant Office Manager.
JOAN. That's nice, a job with a little upward mobility.
DEBORAH. Don't be like that, JOAN..
JOAN. I'm sorry. I don't know what got into me.
DEBORAH. How are things at school?
JOAN. Swell. Life in the Primary Grades is a real picnic.
The other kindergarten teacher got rapED.Tuesday.
DEBORAH. How terrible.
JOAN. What?
DEBORAH. How terrible for her.
JOAN. Well, of course it was terrible for her. Good Christ, DEBORAH., you really amaze me sometimes, you know that?
A bar. Bernard is seatED.at the bar; he is waiting.
BERNIE. What do you have to do to get a drink in this place, come on a cracker?
Dan and Deb appear at the entrance to the bar.
DANNY. You're going to like BERNIE., you're going to like him a lot. Ah! Ask him to tell you about Korea, he has got some stories you are not going to believe.
Bernard spots them.
BERNIE. Yo! Siddown, siddown, so what are you having?
They all sit down at a table.
DANNY. DEBORAH.?
DEBORAH. Jack Daniels on the Rocks.
BERNIE. So she knows what she's talking about, huh? (To Deb.) Black or Green?
DEBORAH. Black.
BERNIE. Okay. And you?
DANNY. The same.
BERNIE. Right back. (He goes to bar.)
DANNY. Well, that's BERNIE..
DEBORAH. Seems like a nice enough sort of fellow.
DANNY. Hell of a guy.
DEBORAH. Is he coming with us to the movies?
Bernard reappears with drinks.
BERNIE. So, actually, I'm Bernard Litko; friend and associate of your pal, DANNY.. And you're DEBORAH..
DEBORAH. DEBORAH. Soloman.
BERNIE. DANNY.'s been telling me a lot about you.
DEBORAH. We only met Wednesday.
BERNIE. He talks about you constantly.
DEBORAH. No!
BERNIE. Yes.
DEBORAH. What does he say?
BERNIE. All the usual things.
Pause.
DANNY. BERNIE. was in Korea.
DEBORAH. Really?
BERNIE. Yeah. You see M*A*S*H on TV? (Pause.) It all looks like that. There isn't one square inch of Korea that doesn't look like that. (Pause.) I'm not kidding. (Pause.)
DEBORAH. When were you there?
BERNIE. '67.
DEBORAH. Really? What were you doing in Korea in 1967?
Pause.
BERNIE. I'm not really at liberty to talk about it.
Pause.
So what do you do?
DEBORAH. I'm an illustrator.
BERNIE. Commercial artist, huh?
DEBORAH. Yes.
BERNIE. Lots of money in that. I mean, that's a hell of a field for a girl.
DANNY. She's very good at it.
BERNIE. I don't doubt it for a second. I mean, look at her for chrissakes. You're a very attractive woman. Anybody ever tell you that? (Pause.) So (Pause.) So okay, so what sign are you?
DEBORAH. Scorpio.
BERNIE. Scorpio, huh?.. Scorpio... how about that.
DEBORAH. What sign are you?
BERNIE. Scorpio.
DEBORAH. How about that. DANNY.'s a Scorpio.
BERNIE. You a Scorpio, Dan?
DANNY. Yes. (Pause.)
BERNIE. Well, I don't want to say it, but it's a small fucking world. (Pause.) So you guys are hitting it off, huh?
The two of you, you're hitting it on/off?
DEBORAH. Well
BERNIE. What the hell, it's early. (To Dan.) You don't even know if she's a keeper yet, for chrissakes. You're young. What the hell. (To Deb.) How old are you?
DANNY. BERNIE., you know you're not supposED.to ask a woman her age.
BERNIE. Dan. Dan, these are modern times. What do you think this is, the past? Women are liberated. You got a right to be what age you are, and so do I, and so does DEBORAH.. (To Deb.) Right?
DEBORAH. Oh, I suppose so.
BERNIE. So what are you? Eighteen ... nineteen.
DEBORAH. Actually, I'm twenty-three.
BERNIE. Well, you don't look it. (Pause.) You know, you're a lucky guy, Dan. And I think you know what I'm taking about. You are one lucky guy. Yes sir, you are one fortunate son of a bitch. And I think I know what I'm talking about.
Dan and Bernard are filing at the office.
BERNIE. One thing, and I want to tell you that if everybody thought of this, Dan, we could do away with income tax (hand me one of those 12-12's, will ya?), there would be no more war (thanks), and you and I could dwell in Earthly Paradise today. (Pause.)
DANNY. What?
BERNIE. Just this:
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. That when she's on her back, her legs are in the air, she's coming like a choo-choo and she's screaming
"don't stop'
-. •
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. I want you to remember .
DANNY. ... yeah? ...
BERNIE. That power.
• (Pause.) ... that power means
responsibility. (Pause.) Remember that.
DANNY. I will.
Pause.
BERNIE. Good.
Outside Deb and JOAN.'s apartment. JOAN. is leaving the apartment. Dan runs into her in the hall.
DANNY. Hi.
JOAN. Hello.
DANNY. I'm looking for DEBORAH..
JOAN. She's not here now.
DANNY. Oh. What is she, out?
JOAN. She's out.
DANNY. I'm supposED.to meet her here.
JOAN. Well, she's not here now. (Pause.)
DANNY. Well, perhaps we could stand out here and tell
each other funny stories until she got back. What do you think?
JOAN. Was she expecting you?
DANNY. I'm supposED.to meet her here.
JOAN. You were supposED.to meet her here when?
DANNY. Now.
JOAN. What time did she say?
DANNY. Around seven.
JOAN. Well, I'll tell her you stoppED.by.
DANNY. Wait. Wait.
... what? Could I have a chair or
something? I'll be glad to wait outside the door. Maybe if you just have a stool and a copy of Boy's Life or something I could read. (Pause.) Why are you being so hostile?
JOAN. I don't like your attitude. (Pause.) DANNY. My name is DANNY. Shapiro.
JOAN. I know who you are.
Dan and Bernard's office. They are filing.
DANNY. You ever do it in a plane?
BERNIE. Yup.
DANNY. Underwater?
BERNIE. Yup.
DANNY. You ever do it in a movie?
BERNIE. Yes I have, Dan. I believe I have, yes. (Pause.) You know what some of 'em like? They like you to get a trite off the beaten track, if you know what i mean. I had this one chick, she usED.to have me wrap her in a bicycle chain and lock her to the radiator before she’d let me do it.
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. Spent five months with that broad before it got cold. A lot of them. They like you to get off the beaten track.
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. Oh yeah. Read your history. The Ancient Greeks ... the French... you heard of King Farouk?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. King Farouk, now one of the shots, I read, he'd pull into some small town, Dubuque, Peoria... he'd go put the make on some waitress.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. So after work, they'd all go back to her place and stART.making it.
DANNY. Uh huh.
BERNIE. The shot of it was this: now secretly, while she was still at work, his men would go divert the local railroad ...
DANNY. Yeah ...
BERNIE. ... and lay the tracks so they went right through the chick's house. Right by the headboard of her bED.and out again on the main line.
DANNY. Uh huh.
BERNIE. So just as she's ready to come ...
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. The King gives a signal, his men run a locomotive right through the broad's bedroom.
DANNY. No.
BERNIE. Yeah. The broads lovED.it. The thing of it was this:
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. King Farouk was a bit kinky. Right?
DANNY. Right?
BERNIE. So get this: There they're humping and bumping ... the chick's about to come ...
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. She hears 'Chugga chugga chugga,' and then wham, the house caves in.
DANNY. Uh huh.
BERNIE. So she sits up in bed, she says 'What's that?', the King goes 'That my dear, is a choo-choo' DANNY. Uh huh.
BERNIE. Then he whacks her on the forehead with a ball-peen hammer.
DANNY. No shit.
BERNIE. Yeah.
Pause.
DANNY. How'd he get away with it?
BERNIE. You shitting me? The King had emissaries all over the country, they'd fix it up so it lookED.like the chick had got hit by a train.
Pause.
He'd take care of their families, though.
DANNY. The girls' families.
BERNIE. Yeah. He'd send them a couple g's. A g or two in savings bonds.
Pause.
DANNY. He could afford it.
BERNIE. Are you shitting me? The man was king of Egypt.
(Pause.) A huge fucking country.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. An ancient land.
DANNY. Yeah.
Pause.
BERNIE. So tell me.
DANNY. What?
BERNIE. How are you getting along with that girl?
DANNY. What girl?
BERNIE. You introducED.me to.
DANNY. DEBORAH.?
BERNIE. DEBORAH., Betty, whatever.
DANNY. Her name's DEBORAH..
BERNIE. I don't know that? I know what her name is, I'm asking you how you're getting on.
DANNY. We're getting on just fine. (Pause.)
BERNIE. That's okay. (Pause.) You don't want to talk about it, we won't think about it.
DANNY. I didn't say I didn't want to talk about it.
Pause.
BERNIE. Does she give head?
DANNY. What?
BERNIE. To you, I'm saying. Does she give head to you.
Pause.
Forget it.
DANNY. You want me to do these 12-12's?
BERNIE. Yeah, do'em. Do'em. (Pause.)
DANNY. You ever make it with an Oriental?
BERNIE. No. I spent eighteen months in Korea jacking off.
Do the 12-12's, huh?
JOAN. and Deb's apartment. The evening. They are sitting around.
JOAN. I don't know, I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. I don't know. (Pause.)
DEBORAH. You don't know what?
JOAN. I don't know anything, DEBORAH., I swear to god, the older I get the less I know. (Pause.) It's a puzzle. Our efforts at coming to grips with ourselves... in an attempt to become 'more human' (which, in itself is an interesting concept). It has to do with an increasED.ability to recognize clues... and the control of energy in the form of lust ... and desire ... (And also in the form of hope.) But a finite puzzle. Whose true solution lies, perhaps, in transcending the rules themselves... (Pause.) ... and pounding of the fucking pieces into places where they DO NOT FIT AT ALL.
Pause.
Those of us who have seen the hands of the Master Magician move a bit too slowly do have a rough time from time to time.
Pause.
Some things persist. (Pause.) 'Loss' is always possible ...
Pause.
Phone rings.
DEBORAH. I'll take it in the other roon. (Goes.)
Dan and Bernard's office. Closing up. Dan and Bernard are securing the office at the end of the day.
BERNIE. So what are we doing tomorrow, we going to the beach?
DANNY. I'm seeing DEBORAH..
BERNIE. Yeah? You getting serious? I mean seemED.like a hell of a girl, huh? The little I saw of her. Not too this, not too that... very kind of... what? (Pause.) Well, what the fuck. I only saw her for a minute. I mean first impressions of this kind are often misleading, huh? So what can you tell from seeing a broad one, two, ten times.
You're seeing a lot of this broad. You getting serious? But what the fuck, that's your business. Right?
DANNY. Umm.
BERNIE. So what are you guys going to do, maybe ... what? Go to the zoo, or shopping? ... She lookED.very intellectual.
DANNY. Um.
BERNIE. That's not always a bad thing.
DANNY. No.
BERNIE. I mean what the fuck, a guy wants to get it on with some broad on a more or less stable basis, who is to say him no. (Pause.) A lot of these broads, you know, you just don't know. You know? I mean what with where they've been and all. I mean a young woman in today's society ... time she's twenty two-three. You don't know where the fuck she's been. (Pause.) I'm just talking to you, you understand.
Dan's apartment. Dan and Deb are in bed.
DANNY. So tell me.
DEBORAH. What?
DANNY. Everything. Tell me the truth about everything.
Menstruation. I know you're holding out on me.
DEBORAH. It would be hard on me if it got out.
DANNY. I swear.
DEBORAH. It's under our conscious control.
DANNY. I knew it!
DEBORAH. We just do it to drive you crazy with the mess.
DANNY. I just knew it ...
DEBORAH. Now you tell me some.
DANNY. Name it.
DEBORAH. What does it feel like to have a penis?
DANNY. Strange. Very strange and wonderful.
DEBORAH. Do you miss having tits?
DANNY. To be completely frank with you, that is the stupidest question I ever heard. What man in his right mind would want tits?
DEBORAH. You're right of course. (Pause.) Ask me if I like the taste of come.
DANNY. Do you like the taste of come?
DEBORAH. Do I like the taste of come?
DANNY. Yes.
DEBORAH. Dan, I love the taste of come. It tastes like everything.. good.. just ... coming out of your cock ... the Junior Prom ... an autumn afternoon...
DANNY. It doesn't taste a little bit like Chlorox?
DEBORAH. It smells like Chlorox. It tastes like the Junior Prom. (Pause.) See what you cheat yourself of?
DANNY. Yes.
DEBORAH. Faggot. (Pause.)
DANNY. Do you ever fantasize about making love with other women?
DEBORAH. Do you fantasize when we make love? (Pause.)
The last time we made love, I fantasizED.about other
women.
DANNY. The last time I masturbatED.I kept thinking about my left hand.
DEBORAH. Did you?
DANNY. Yes.
DEBORAH. Did you?
DANNY. Yes.
Pause.
I love making love with you.
DEBORAH. I love making love with you. (Pause.)
DANNY. I love you.
DEBORAH. Does it frighten you to say that?
DANNY. Yes.
DEBORAH. It's only words. I don't think you should be frightenED.by words.
Nursery School. JOAN. is lecturing two toddlers.
JOAN. What are you doing? Where are you going? What are you doing? You stay right there. Now. What were the two of you doing? I'm just asking a simple question.
There's nothing to be ashamED.of. (Pause.) I can wait.
Were you playing 'Doctor? (Pause.) 'Doctor.' Don't play dumb with me, just answer the question. (You know, that attitude is going to get you in a lot of trouble someday.) Were you playing with each other's genitals? Each other's ... 'pee-pees'?.. whatever you call them at home, that's what I'm asking (and don't play dumb, because I saw what you were doing, so just own up to it). (Pause.) All right... no. No, stop that, there's no reason for tears... it's perfectly... natural. But... there's a time and a place for everything. Now.. no, it's all right. Come on.
Come on, we're all going in the other room, and we're going to wash our hands. And then Miss Webber is going to call our parents.
The Toy Department at Marshall Field's. Bernard and Dan are shopping for a gift.
DANNY. Whose birthday?
BERNIE. My nephew Bobby.
DANNY. How old is he now?
BERNIE. Going to be ... six. Will you look at that?
DANNY. What?
BERNIE. They got a fucking fruit at the games counter. I can't believe this. In the midst of the toy department. At the games counter, talking to the kids all day long ... a fairy.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. You know, one of those motherfuckers grabbED.me when I was Bobby's age.
DANNY. Where?
BERNIE. At the movies, where else? We're all wondering what this old guy is doing at the cartoons, and he sits down at the end of the row, and halfway through he reaches over and grabs my joint. Reaches over another guy and grabs me by the joint.
DANNY. Was he rough?
BERNIE. What?
DANNY. I mean, was he rough about it?
BERNIE. Rough? (Pause.) I mean... (Pause.) Rough? What difference how he grabbED.me? I mean, he's a guy.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE.
And I'm a guy. (Pause.) But at the time I was only a kid, for chrissakes. (Pause.)
DANNY. You ever do that stuff when you were kids?
BERNIE. What stuff?
DANNY. You know. Stuff with other kids.
BERNIE. Teasing? Like teasing the girls? Looking up their panties and so on?
DANNY. No, I mean when you were really young kids.
Fooling around with the other kids... the other boys.
BERNIE. Fooling around? You mean like 'messing' around with other boys?
DANNY. Fuck no. I didn't mean that. I just meant... you know.
BERNIE. (Pause.) You mean fooling around! Sure, who didn't.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. Shit, we all usED.to fuck around.
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. Even when we were little, shit. I mean you learn when you're young, right?
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. And what you learn, that's what you know. Am I right?
DANNY. One HundrED.Percent. It's all in your ...
BERNIE. Head
DANNY. … approach (Pause.)
BERNIE. It's in your what?
DANNY. Approach?
BERNIE. Right.
DANNY. You know how to approach these things and you'll always be all right.
BERNIE. You don't learn right when you're young, those cocksuckers ruin your life.
DANNY. Who? (Pause.)
BERNIE. Anybody. (Pause.) Ruin it quicker'n you can turn around.
DANNY. Take you and that guy in the movies, for instance.
BERNIE. What do you mean?
DANNY. Just that if you'd been a little older ...
BERNIE. Yeah?
DANNY. Or maybe the guy, if he'd been a little .. younger •
BERNIE. What are you fucking talking about?
DANNY. I'm saying that if the circumstances ...
BERNIE. What fucking circumstances? Some faggot queer got the hots for my joint at the cartoons.
DANNY. I'm not talking about extenuating circumstances, I only mean the circumstances of what happened.
BERNIE. And what exactly are you saying about them?
DANNY. All I'm saying ...
BERNIE. ... this happenED.years ago...
DANNY.... is that it could possibly have been damaging to you. (Pause.)
BERNIE. Yeah?
DANNY. ... as a total Human Being.
BERNIE. Damn right.
DANNY.... and you're just lucky that it didn't.
BERNIE. Well, what the fuck, I was only a kid.
DANNY. Sure.
BERNIE. A kid laughs these things off. You forget, you go on living... what the fuck, huh?
Deb and JOAN.'s apartment. Late at night. They are lounging.
JOAN. Let's face it. He would prematurely ejaculate.
There's no nicer way to say it. And the sooner he would come the guiltier he would feel and the sooner he would come. Because in some ways, of course, he was doing it to punish me. And he was doing a hell of a job of it.
So one day I said to him 'Look, I'm in bED.to make love with you, and you're in bED.to make love with me. So why don't we just relax, and I'll be with you, and you be with me, and whenever you want to come is fine.' (Pause.) But he still kept prematurely ejaculating. (Pause.) Although he did seem happier about it. (Pause.) Tableau.
DEBORAH. We have any tuna fish?
JOAN. I think I ate it. (Tableau.)
The Health Club. Bernard in the gym talking to imaginary buddies.
BERNIE. So the kid asks me 'BERNIE. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. The broad this, the broad that, blah blah blah. Right? So I tell him, 'Dan, Dan, you think I don't know what you're feeling, I don't know what you're going through? You think about the broad, you this, you that, you think I don't know that?' So he tells me, 'BERNIE.,' he says, 'I think I love her?' (Pause.)
Twenty-eight years old.
So I tell him, 'Dan, Dan, I can advise, I can counsel, I can speak to you out of my experience... but in the final analysis, you are on your own. (Pause.) If you want my opinion, however, you are pussy-whipped.' (I call 'em like I see 'em. I wouldn't say it if it wasn't so.) So what does he know at that age, huh? Sell his soul for a little eating pussy, and who can blame him. But mark my words: one, two more weeks, he'll do the right thing by the broad.
(Pause.) And drop her like a fucking hot potato.
JOAN. and Deb are out to lunch.
JOAN.
... and, of course, there exists the very real possibility that the whole thing is nothing other than a mistake of rather large magnitude, and that it never was supposED.to work out.
DEBORAH. Do you really believe that?
JOAN. I don't know. I really don't know. I think I do. Well, look at your divorce rate. Look at the incidence of homosexuality... the number of violent, sex-connectED.crimes (this dressing is for shit) ... all the antisocial behaviour that chooses sex as its form of expression. Eh?
DEBORAH. I don't know.
JOAN. ... physical and mental mutilations we perpetrate on each other, day in, day out... trying to fit ourselves to a pattern we can neither understand (although we pretend to) nor truly afford to investigate (although we pretend to). (Pause.) Come on, disagree with me.
DEBORAH. I disagree with you.
JOAN. It's a dirty joke, DEBORAH., the whole godforsaken business.
DEBORAH. I disagree with you.
JOAN. That's your right. Are you going to eat your roll?
(Deb shakes her head) Then perhaps / could have it. (Takes roll.) This roll is excellent.
DEBORAH. I'm moving in with DANNY..
JOAN. I give you two months.
Dan and Bernard's office. Dan is filing. Bernard is talking on the phone.
BERNIE. …so then she brings the dog in. 'What's the pooch for?' I say. 'Shut up and watch,’ she says. 'You
might learn something.' … at the Laugh-Inn. (Pause.)
They're open all night. (Pause.) No, they don't. (Pause.) I'm telling you they're open all night.
DANNY. They're open all night, Bern.
BERNIE. (to phone) I'm sorry. (To Dan.) What?
DANNY. They're open all night.
BERNIE. Yeah. (To phone.) They're open all night. (Pause.) A guy in the office. So then she gets down on the carpet with the dog ...
DANNY. You want me to do these 11'13's?
BERNIE. (to Dan) Yeah. (To phone.) So I'm just watching at this point. (Pause.) I'm getting to that. So the fucking dog, and may I be struck dead by lightning, his eyes light up, and he starts to grin ... (Pause.) ... a fox terrier.


Dan and Deb move Deb out of her apartment. JOAN. is in the background.
DANNY. You have very interesting taste in music.
DEBORAH. A lot of them are JOAN.'s.
DANNY. I'm sorry... uh ... (To JOAN..) uh, which of these are yours? You want to separate them?
JOAN. Well, they aren't going to separate themselves, now, are they?
DANNY. No, I don't suppose they are. Why don't you separate them, JOAN.? (Pause.)
DEBORAH. DANNY. has a sauna in his building.
JOAN. How nice... sweating ... Do you use your sauna often, DANNY.?
DANNY. I use the sauna from time to time. I'm fortunate in being blessED.with the ability to sweat in the everyday course of events.
DEBORAH. (to JOAN.) What are we going to do about the television?
JOAN. Do you want to take it?
DANNY. I have a television.
JOAN. Let me just pay you for your half of it.
DEBORAH. You could send me a cheque.
JOAN. I could give you a cheque. You're not going to California for God's sake.
DEBORAH. I can pick it up next week.
JOAN. When?
DEBORAH. Whenever is convenient.
JOAN. Can you come by Tuesday night?... (To Dan.)
Can she come by Tuesday night?
DANNY. That's very good. That's very funny. Now could you find it in your heART.to take the table lamp and shove it up your ass?
JOAN. Ah, that's very telling. On your instructions, I'm supposED.to rend and torture myself anally. Is that what you like? Does DEBORAH. know about this? You're moving
out, move out.
DANNY. She's moving out.
JOAN. Well, move her out, then and the hell with you.
(Pause. To Deb.) I hope you're very happy.
Bernard is at the office declaiming to some co-workers.
BERNIE. Equal Rights Amendment? Equal Rights Amendment? I'll give you the fucking Equal Rights Amendment. Nobody ever wrote me no fucking amendments. Special interest groups, okay... but who's kidding who here, huh? (Pause.) We got baby seals dying in Alaska and we're writing amendments for broads? I mean, I'm a big fan of society ... but this bites the big one.
I'm sorry•
Dan and Deb's apartment. The morning. They are each getting ready for work.
DANNY. Do we have any shampoo?
DEBORAH. I don't know.
DANNY. You wash your hair at least twice a day. Shampoo is a staple item of your existence. Of course you know.
DEBORAH. All right. I do. Know.
DANNY. Do we have any shampoo?
DEBORAH. I don't know. Is your hair dirty?
DANNY. Does my hair look dirty?
DEBORAH. Does it feel dirty? (Pause.) It looks dirty.
DANNY. It feels greasy. I hate it when my hair feels greasy.
DEBORAH. Well, I'm not going to look. If you want to know if there's any shampoo, you go look for it.
DANNY. You don't have to look. You know very well if there's any shampoo or not. You're making me be ridiculous about this. (Pause.) You wash yourself too much anyway. If you really usED.all that shit they tell you in Cosmopolitan (and you do) you'd be washing yourself from morning till night. Pouring derivatives on yourself all day long.
DEBORAH. Will you love me when I'm old?
DANNY. If you can manage to look eighteen, yes.
DEBORAH. Now, that's very telling.
DANNY. You think so?
DEBORAH. Yes.
DANNY. I'm going to wash my hair. Is there any shampoo?
DEBORAH. Yes. And no.
DANNY. Now what's that supposED.to mean?
DEBORAH. Everything. And nothing. (Pause.) Would you get my hose?
DANNY. No. Where does this come from? This whole fucking behaviour. You're making it up. 'Get my hose.' You want your hose, I'll get your hose. Here's your fucking hose. (Rummages in dresser.) Where's your hose?
(Pause.) What do they call them, anyway? Nobody says
'hose.'
DEBORAH. Pantyhose.
DANNY. Where are they?
DEBORAH. Get me some out of the laundry bag.
DANNY. You're going to wear dirty hose?
DEBORAH. I think I'm out of clean ones.
DANNY. So you're going downtown in dirty hose?
DEBORAH. Do you want me walking around with a nakED.la-la?
DANNY. If it makes you happy, Deb. I'm on the side of whatever makes you happy.
Deb retrieves dirty hose from bag and starts changing into them.
DANNY. You make me very horny.
DEBORAH. It's the idea of the dirty panties, Dan. You're
sick.
DANNY. I love your breasts.
DEBORAH. 'Thank you.' (Pause.) Is that right?
DANNY. Fuck you.
DEBORAH. No hard feelings.
DANNY. Who said there were?
DEBORAH. You know there are.
DANNY. Then why say there aren't?
Dan's office. Dan is talking to an imaginary co-worker.
DANNY. ... no, wait a second. Wait a second. I want to tell you this. I know what you're saying, and I'm telling you I don't like you bad mouthing the guy, who happens to be a friend of mine. So just let me tell my story, okay?
So the other day we're up on six and it's past five and I'm late, and I'm having some troubles with my chick (this chick I've been seeing) and I push the button and the elevator doesn't come, and it doesn't come, and it doesn't come, so I lean back and I kick the shit out of it three or four times (1 was really hot). And he, he puts his arm around my shoulder and he calms me down and he says, Dan, Dan,., don't go looking for affection from inanimate objects.' (Pause.) Huh? (Pause.) So I don't want to hear you badmouthing BERNIE. Litko.
Dan and Deb in bED.late at night. Deb is sleeping.
DANNY. DEBORAH.. Deb? Deb? You up?
Pause.
You sleeping?
Pause.
I can't sleep.
Pause.
You asleep?
Pause.
Huh?
Pause.
You sleeping, Deb?
Pause.
What are you thinking about?
Pause.
Deb?
Pause.
Did I wake you up?
A movie theatre. Dan and Bernard are watching a pornographic movie.
BERNIE. Don't tell me that's that guy's joint. Whatever you do don't tell me that. That's not his joint. Tell me it's not his joint, Dan.
DANNY. It's his joint.
BERNIE. I don't want to hear it.
DANNY. That's what it is.
BERNIE. I don't want to hear it, so don't tell it to me.
Nobody is hung like that. If that's his joint I'm going to go home and blow my brains out.
DANNY. He probably usED.a stand-in. (Pause.)
BERNIE. I can't stand this. I can't fucking stand this. Lookit that broad!
DANNY. Which one?
BERNIE. Which one? The one she looks a bit like whatsername.
DANNY. Like DEBORAH.?
BERNIE. Yeah.
DANNY. Which one is that?
BERNIE. That one.
DANNY. You think she looks like DEBORAH.?
BERNIE. Yeah. You see what I mean?
DANNY. No. You think she's pretty?
BERNIE. Pretty? What the fuck are you talking about?
(Pause.) You know this fucking house has changed.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. I mean, they still got the guys jerkin' off under the Trib in the front row ...
DANNY. World's Greatest Newspaper.
BERNIE.... but they got a lot of scum in here now. Wait, now. Wait. Do you see that. Will you look at the fucking that?
DANNY. What?
BERNIE. That break in the action... they shiftED.scenes .. where they changED.the camera angle... you know why they do that? You know why? Because the guy came is why, and they shift angles and wait a while so it looks like he's fucking for hours. You see that?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. These guys got no control. (Pause.) What was I saying?
DANNY. How the house has changed.
BERNIE. They got a lot of scum in here now. DO YOU SEE THAT? DO YOU FUCKING BELIEVE THAT?
(Pause.) A woman blowing a man's natural. A woman blowing a dog's disgusting. (Pause.) Yeah, that's what I think, and I'm not ashamED.to say it!
Dan and Deb at their apartment. In the midst of an all-night argument.
DEBORAH. Oh, shut up.
DANNY. I should shut up? Who's talking for the last twelve hours straight, huh?
DEBORAH. motions him away in disgust.
... blah blah blah, blah blah blah, blah blah blah. Jesus.
Some people go home with the Tribune. You go home with me. Everything's fine. Sex, talk, life, everything. Until you want to get 'closer,' to get 'better.' Do you know what the fuck you want?
Push. You push me.
Why can't you just see it for what it is?
DEBORAH. What?
DANNY. Us.
DEBORAH. And what is it?
DANNY. What it is, no more no less.
DEBORAH. And what is that?
DANNY. Don't give me this. Don't give me that look.
Missy.
DEBORAH. Or you're gonna what?
DANNY. I don't mind physical violence. I just can't stand emotional violence. (Pause.) I'm sorry. I'm sorry Deb.
(Pause.) I forget who I'm talking to. I'm sorry. You're very good for me, come here. (Pause.) Come here.
DEBORAH. No. You come here for Christ's fucking sake.
You want comfort, come get comfort. What am I, your toaster?
DANNY. Cunt.
DEBORAH. That's very good. 'Cunt', good. Get it out. Let it all out.
DANNY. You cunt.
DEBORAH. We've establishED.that.
DANNY. I try.
DEBORAH. You try and try. You are misunderstood and depressed.
DANNY. And you're no help.
DEBORAH. No, I'm a hindrance. You're trying to understand women and I'm confusing you with information. 'Cunt' won't do it. 'Fuck' won't do it. No more magic. What are you feeling. Tell me what you're feeling. Jerk.
Deb alone.
DEBORAH. My mother usED.to tell a story about how I came into the kitchen one day while she was preparing an important dish. I was about four. I said, 'Mommy, can I have a cookie?', and she for some reason misunderstood or misheard me, and thought that I said that I wantED.a hug,
so she gave me a 'hug, and I said 'Thank you,
Mommy. I didn't want a cookie after all?
(Pause.) You see? What is a sublimation of what? (Pause.)
What signifies what?
Dan at Bernard's apartment. The middle of the night. They are drunk.
BERNIE. Tits and Ass. Tits and Ass. Tits and Ass. Tits and Ass. Blah de Bloo. Blah de Bloo. Blah de Bloo. Blah de Bloo. (Pause.) Huh?
DANNY. I don't know.
BERNIE. So don't know. Big deal - you are going to lose your head over a little bit of puss? You are going to sell your birthright for a mess of potash? 'Oh, BERNIE., she's this. Oh, BERNIE., she's that ..
You know what she is?
She's a fucking human being just like you and me, Dan.
We all have basically the same desires, and the shame of it is you get out of touch with yourself and lose your perspective. Huh?
Pause.
Huh?
Yeah. You think you're playing with kids? (Pause.) Don't ever lose your sense of humour, Dan. Don't ever lose your sense of humour.
Dan and Deb at their apartment. Splitting up their belongings.
DANNY. ... and your friend, JOAN.... that cunt was born in a carcrash. (Pause.) And your job is a lot of busy-work, you know that?
DEBORAH. I know.
DANNY. And I have no fucking idea what your drawings mean. (Pause.) And you're a lousy fuck.
DEBORAH. I know.
DANNY. Your friend, JOAN., is a better fuck than you are.
DEBORAH. I'm sure she is.
DANNY.... and she's a lousy fuck. (Pause.) Aren't you going to tell me I'm a lousy fuck?
DEBORAH. You are a lousy fuck.
DANNY. You're fulla shit.
Deb and JOAN. at their apartment.
JOAN. You learn from your mistakes, DEBORAH.. Man is the one animal who has that capacity.
DEBORAH. Yes.
JOAN. You can't live in the past.
DEBORAH. No.
JOAN. It does you no good.
DEBORAH. I know it.
JOAN. And, in the end, what do you have? You have your friends. (Pause.) Have you been drawing since you've been with Dan?
DEBORAH. It wasn't his fault.
JOAN. Well, whose fault was it, mine?
DEBORAH. It was my fault, JOAN..
JOAN. It was not your fault. Say what you will, the facts don't change and the fact is if you take a grown man whose actions and whose outlook are those of a child, who wants nothing more or better than to have someone who will lick his penis and grin at his bizarre idea of wit, uh ... if you take that man and uh
DEBORAH. I'll thank you for this someday.
JOAN. Yes, you will, Deb. And you know, I truly don't see why you're being so hostile. I'm afraid I have to admit that.
JOAN. is reading a story to her imaginary toddlers.
JOAN.... and when the Prince came home that night, she had changED.into an old Hag (so of course he was very surprised).
' Where is my beautiful wife?' he askED.the Hag.
'And what have you done with her?' And she said, 'I am your wife.'
(That's right.)
I can be beautiful during the daylight hours so that you and your friends can admire me, or I can be beautiful at night, so that you can enjoy me by the fireside, and so on.
But for one half of the day I must be this old Hag you see before you?'
Pause.
A 'hag' is an ugly old lady.
Pause.
Well, how do you think it's spelled?
Pause.
Well, how does it sound?
Pause.
That's right. And so she told him...
Dan and Bernard are on the beach. They are looking at
attractive women.
BERNIE. Lookit this.
DANNY. Where?
BERNIE. Lookit this.
DANNY. Where?
BERNIE. There.
DANNY. Oh yeah.
BERNIE. My sweet goodness.
DANNY. Uh huh.
BERNIE. What a sensitive young lady.
DANNY. Check this one out.
BERNIE. Don't bother me.
DANNY. I'm telling you.
BERNIE. Where?
DANNY. Two o'clock.
BERNIE. (looks) Oh no!
DANNY. Yes.
BERNIE. Oh no!
DANNY. I'm afraid so.
BERNIE. I see no reason to go on living.
DANNY. Ummm.
BERNIE. There can be no more to life.
DANNY. Yes.
BERNIE. In a way it's sad. To think I gaze upon the highest man can wish for ...
DANNY. BERNIE. ...
BERNIE. His destiny ...
DANNY. BERNIE. ...
BERNIE. The fruition of a pain-laden stay on earth ...
DANNY. Hey, BERNIE., isn't that what sername?
BERNIE. Her?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. Is she who?
DANNY. Whatzername, who you introducED.me to last week.
BERNIE. Naaa. This broad is much better looking.
DANNY. I think it's her.
BERNIE. This broad has a lot more class.
DANNY. No ...
BERNIE. Lookit her boobs. (Pause.) Am I right or not?
DANNY. Yeah, I think you're right.
BERNIE. Hey! Don't look behind you.
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. Whatever you do, don't look behind you.
DANNY. Where?
BERNIE. Right behind you, about ten feet behind you to your right.
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. I'm telling you.
DANNY. (looks) Get the fuck outta here!
BERNIE. Can I pick 'em?
DANNY. BERNIE. ...
BERNIE. Is the radar in fine shape?
DANNY. ... I gotta say ...
BERNIE. ... Oh yeah ...
DANNY. ... that you can pick 'em.
BERNIE. I know I can. And will you look at the chick in the two piece wet-look jobbie?
DANNY. Where?
BERNIE. Where I'm looking. (Pause.) Those legs ...
DANNY. Oh no!
BERNIE.. all the way up to her ass!
DANNY. Jesus.
BERNIE. And beyond for all we know.
DANNY. You said it.
BERNIE. Lookit her.
DANNY. Yup.
BERNIE. Fuckin' lookit her.
DANNY. I know it.
BERNIE. Tell me she is not flaunting herself all over the beach.
DANNY. She is casting it to the winds.
BERNIE. Look at that suit.
DANNY. Bern... BERNIE.... I think that I can see her snatch.
BERNIE. You're fulla shit.
DANNY. On my honour. I can see her fucking snatch.
BERNIE. You can see her snatch?
DANNY. I'm telling you.
BERNIE. (looks) I can't make it out.
DANNY. At the top of her legs.
BERNIE. I known where it is, I just can't see it.
DANNY. When she breathes in. You gotta look close.
Pause. They look.
BERNIE. Where does she get off with that noise?
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. That fuckin' pisses me off.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. That pisses the fuck off outta me.
DANNY. I know.
BERNIE. Piss.
DANNY. Cockteaser.
BERNIE. Prissy little cunt.
DANNY. Right on the beach.
BERNIE. Piss me off.
DANNY. Little prude.
BERNIE. On the fucking beach.
DANNY. And those tits!
BERNIE. Don't talk to me about tits.
DANNY. Nice firm tits.
BERNIE. Where does she get off with those tits?
DANNY. What a pair of boobs.
BERNIE. Not that I'm a tit man
DANNY. I know.
BERNIE. I mean, I dig tits ...
DANNY. I don't blame you,
BERNIE. ... but I wouldn't go out of my way for a pair of tits.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. The way I see it, tits ...
DANNY. Yeah?
BERNIE. ... are what you make of 'em.
DANNY. It's like anything else.
BERNIE. But an ass .
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. ... is an ass.
DANNY. Goes without saying. You know what I like?
BERNIE. What?
DANNY. Stomach muscles.
BERNIE. You're talking about flab.
DANNY. Yeah.
BERNIE. I know what you're talking about.
DANNY. I know you do.
BERNIE. Flab.
DANNY. Fuckin' flab.
BERNIE. Who needs it?
DANNY. More trouble than it's worth.
BERNIE. A nice pair of legs though ...
DANNY. I know it.
BERNIE. ... is like money from home.
DANNY. A home away from home.
BERNIE. Now look over there to illustrate my point.
DANNY. The broad?
BERNIE. Right. Nice legs, eh?
DANNY. Yup.
BERNIE. Very acceptable old ass
DANNY. Nice, firm.
BERNIE. Flat belly, beautiful pair of tits.
DANNY. No question.
BERNIE. Now she is fine. (Pause.)
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. But now look over there. The broad with the dumpy legs and the fat whatdayacallit.
DANNY. Stomach.
BERNIE. Her legs are for shit, her stomach is dumpy, her tits don't say anything for her, and her muscle tone is not good.
DANNY. Right.
BERNIE. Now she is not a good-looking girl. (Pause.) In fact she is something of a pig. (Pause.) You see? That's all it takes... to make the difference between a knockout looking broad, and a nothing looking broad who doesn't look like anything. (Pause.) You see my point?
DANNY. ... yeah?
BERNIE. Makes all the fucking difference in the world.
(Pause.) Coming out here on the beach. Lying all over the beach, flaunting their bodies. I mean who the fuck do they think they are all of a sudden, coming out here and just flaunting their bodies all over? (Pause.) I mean, what are you supposED.to think? I come to the beach with a friend to get some sun and watch the action and ... I mean a fellow comes to the beach to sit out in the fucking sun, am I wrong?.. I mean we're talking about
recreational fucking space, huh?.. huh? (Pause.) What the fuck am I talking about?
DANNY. Are you feeling all right?
BERNIE. Well, how do I look, do I look all right?
DANNY. Sure.
BERNIE. Well, then let's assume that I feel all right, okay?
DANNY. Okay.
BERNIE. I mean, how could you feel anything but all right, for chrissakes? Will you look at that body? (Pause.) What a pair of tits. (Pause.) With tits like that, who needs .. anything.
A long pause. They watch an imaginary woman pass in front of them.
BERNIE. Hi.
DANNY. Hello there.
Pause. She walks by.
BERNIE. She's probably deaf.
DANNY. She did look deaf, didn't she.
BERNIE. Yeah. (Pause.)
DANNY. Deaf bitch.
At risc: Arthur and Edmond are in the office.
ART.The Metaphysical Restaurant.
ED.Yes?
ART.You pick up the menu: Idea of Ham', 88.50;
Conception of Veal, 50.85... "Preconception of Veal,'
$12.00 (eh?) ...
'Thoughts of Asparagus' $3.50. Low
overhead... dictetic... but my question.
ED.Yes?
ART.My question ...
ED.Yes?
ART.Is what do you do when they want you to hold the
potatoes?
ED.What do you do?
ART.That is the question.
ED.(The metaphysical restaurant.)
ART.It's just an idea really.
ED.Um.
ART.You can't hold an imaginary potato.
ED.Um.
ART.Not the best day you were born.
ED.No.
ART.You can hold it in your mind ...
ED.Yes.
ART.But that's about it. (ART.crumples wrappings from foodstuffs.) Enough lovemaking. (Hands them to Ed.) Throw this junk out, will you? Now, where were we?
ED.At the man.
ART.Ah, yes. The man.
ED.Yes.
ART.Here it comes. The man ...
ED.Yes?
ART.Now, the man... the man is in the park ED.(transcribing) I've got it.
ART.He is sitting in the park regarding squirrels.
ED.Yes.
ART.He sits down on a bench ...
ED.Uh huh.
ART.He clucks and a squirrel comes over. He has nothing to feED.it.
ED.Mmmmmm.
ART.He moves to stroke the squirrel and the squirrel bites his hand. With his other hand he grabs the squirrel and squeezes it until the creature dies. (Pause.) Eh?
ART.Yes?
ART.What do you think?
ED.What does it mean?
ART.To me, or in general?
ED.Either.
ART.Well, I don't know.
ED.Mmmm.
ART.I'm not sure at this point.
ED.(pause) It's gutsy, Arthur.
ART.Mmmm.
ED.It's very gutsy.
ART.Thank you.
ED.Perhaps overly gutsy.
ART.Mmm.
ED.And awfully short.
guts?
ART.You think perhaps a greater length would temper its
ED.Are you asking facetiously?
ART.Not at all.
ED.Mmmm.
ART.Why do you ask?
ED.For my own information.
ART.Ahhhh.
ED.Could I read you something?
ART.Not while we're working.
ED.What happens to the fellow?
ART.I don't know.
ED.Does he die?
ART.From a squirrel bite?
ED.Not necessarily.
ART.Not necessarily.
ED.Not from the bite, then.
ART.Then yes, he does.
ED.Um. Um. Perhaps... having nothing to give the squirrel, he shouldn't have clucked.
ART.There needn't be a moral.
ED.No?
ART.Heck no. One writes what one feels.
ED.Yes. Um. Um. What does the squirrel represent?
ART.The squirrel?
ED.Yes.
ART.I do not know.
ED.(A potentially non-representational animal).
ART.How about this ...
ED.(Provocative)
ART.A man is walking in the park amongst (or among) the squirrels...
ED.Yes ...
ART.(You're doing quite well by the way.)
ED.Thank you.
ART.He sees a fellow running. ChasED.by another fellow.
ED.... yes.
ART.The fellow chasing shouts 'Stop that man! (Aha.) The man walking stops and considers. 'Should I try to stop that man? What is the identity of the fellow chasing the other fellow? By what authority does he ask me that I stop the guy? The other fellow, what would he request, if given the opportunity? (I wonder where they went to school, etc.) On which note he sits on a convenient bench.
ED.Yes.
ART.On another end of which is perched... you guessED.it ... a squirrel.
ED.(pause) And then?
ART.What?
ED.And then what?
ART.(pause) And then.
ED.Yes?
ART.He goes over to the squirrel...
ED.Has he anything to feED.it?
ART.... No.
ED.I think we've done that one.
ART.Not quite so quickly. He goes over to the squirrel, (having nothing to feED.it) and sits on its portion of the bench. He is about to initiate some action when he is arrestED.by shouts coming from down-path (or from down
"the' path). The shouts (and pay attention here) come from the very two men who have just run past. They are fighting. They are fighting with each other ... about something ... or other. (Pause.) Which took place previously. (Pause.) And who can blame them? Well, what do you think?
ED.... well ...
ART.Well, toss it out then. We'll not be hidebound by convention, eh? We stART.afresh. We search for guts. A simple man (which is to say, a man not heretofor investED.with qualities) goes to the park to feED.a squirrel. Wait. A man goes to the park to feed.squirrels. (Pause.) A man accustomED.to feeding squirrels finds himself one day in the park. (Pause.) Into a park usually inhabitED.by squirrels there came one day a man. (Pause.) The park!
Scene of human violence and animal hunger!
ED.How about this ...
ART.Wait! I have it. Three men and a squirrel were in the park.
ED.Umm.
ART.For the purpose of simplicity (and pay attention here) we can divide these four figures into two distinctive units.
ED.Umm.
ART.One unit can consist of two men. They can be seen to have had some previous intercourse. Eh?
ED.Yes.
ART.I mean, they run through going tar, ch hang ho
other, I mean, what are you going to think eh?
ED.Yes.
ART.Alright. So. The second unit shall consist of the remaining man and the squirrel. Now. One man is chasing another. One man is sitting near a squirrel. One man is running down a path presumably being pursuED.by the initial man who is saying 'Stop that man' (his remarks being most probably addressED.to the man who is sitting near the squirrel) and one squirrel is perchED.on a bench minding what appears to be its own business.
ED.One man and a squirrel sitting on a bench. Two men run by, the initial man being presumably chasED.by a second man calling 'Stop that man'...
ART.I'm referring to the fellow giving pursuit as 'the initial man.'
ED.Oh, I'm sorry.
ART.No, no. Quite alright.
ED.You're sure?
ART.Yes. Absolutely. Now watch. The shouts of the two men (the initial man and his opposite number) draw the attention of the man on the bench from the squirrel which (for reasons best known to himself) he has been observing.
ED.Umm.
ART.The squirrel becomes frightenED.and runs... off.
Now. Before the gaze of the man on the bench can return to the bench, the space previously taken by the squirrel has been occupiED.BY ANOTHER SQUIRREL!
ED.(pause) There were three men and two squirrels in the park ...
it ai, ai eat on i not do it o do. The
ED.Yes?
ART.What do you mean, 'Yes?' Yes, of course it is. (Pause.) Well, think about it.
ED.(pause) Yes, I see your point.
ART.No wait, you're wrong. Now watch. A man incapable of distinguishing between squirrels goes to the park.
The CLEANING WOMAN.enters.
CLEANING WOMAN.(to Ed). You wanna beer?
ART.No thank you, no.
CLEANING WOMAN.(to Ed) You, you wanna beer?
ED.No thank you.
CLEANING WOMAN.Who's the guy?
ART.My new colleague.
CLEANING WOMAN.Oh, yeah?
ART.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.You doing any good?
ED.Just fine.
CLEANING WOMAN.Aha!
ED.And you?
CLEANING WOMAN.An, the usual stuff. Cleaning up shit ...being lovable, the same old stuff.
ED.Um.
CLEANING WOMAN.You wanna hear one?
ED.One what?
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, listen, you'll find out. Here goes.
(Glances at pad.) 'What's sauce for the goose…
ED.Yes?
CLEANING WOMAN.…is the moss for the moose" Huh?
ART.Very insightful.
CLEANING WOMAN.I just made that up in the hall.
ED.Mmmm.
CLEANING WOMAN.So here's your content. Somebody says to his wife, 'I don't want you having sexual intercourse with anyone except me,' (To Ed.) I'm not going to offend you, am I?
ED.I don't think so.
CLEANING WOMAN.So, the next day she comes home from the track and what do you think, he's balling her sister. (this is a true story by the way, this actually happenED.to me.) So she says, 'What the fuckin' piss are you doing?" and FrED.says 'I'm balling your sister.' To which one could reply. 'What's sauce for the goose is moss for the moose.'
(Pause.) It's a variation on a theme. You been around the block. You know the actual old saying, 'What's sauce for the goose is ... uh ... sauce for the gander.' But let me ask you something.
ED.Alright.
CLEANING WOMAN.When was the last time you heard that saying used? (Pause.) And you know why? Because it has no meaning in today's society.
ED.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, what the hey, times change.
There's no use crying over spilt milk.
ED.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.I mean, you stop to think about it, there's no use crying over any kind of milk.
ED.No.
CLEANING WOMAN.It's a senseless act.
ED.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.It's the act of a neurotic personality.
ED.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.It's the act of a madman.
ED.Ummm.
CLEANING WOMAN.It's a topsy-turvy anything-can-happen world.
ED.Um.
CLEANING WOMAN.And we're all a hell of a lot better off without it. (Consults pad.) Hey! So listen to this. There's these two guys, right, the Kid and Black Bart, vicious enemies. So the kid says 'Slap leather, Bart' and BART.says,
"Kid the man can beat me to the draw ain't been born yet, and the man don't live who ain't been born yet.' Kid says,
'Enough fucking rhetoric, huh, go for your gun you're getting old.' BART.says, 'Who isn't?' They think about this awhile. Sun sets. Kid says, 'Bar' says, 'What the heck, huh, I got some spare pork and beans over to the campfire, come on over, we'll talk it out, maybe we can settle this thing amicably? BART.says, 'Kid,' says 'Kid, you got yourself a deal.' They go over to the campfire. So there's the campfire. Fucking campfire is full of sidekicks.
Basically, they're Mexican or of Mexican extraction.
Everybody's wrappED.in their blanket. Colder than a witch's tit. Guys say, 'What are you doing with Black Bart, kid?' Kid says, 'We're going to sit down and talk it out, perhaps we can become pals.' Guys say, 'I ain't being pals with no fucking Gringo. Kid says, 'So what do you think I am, Porfirio Diaz?' Fuckin' guys, recognition dawns on their faces, they all slap leather, Kid goes out in a hail of molten lead. They turn on Black Bart. 'Click, click' go their guns. (They're empty.) BART.seizes the main chance, and grabs a horse from a nearby place, gallops into the Western night, never heard from again. Five years later, the horse turns up dirs no at a dog fod planta later, go. One of the bandits (now grow up) recognizes the horse and buys him. His plan, BART.gallopED.off he tore pART.of his shirt on a nearby cactus. The guy has savED.the shirt. He sits in the park with the horse day after day holding the shirt beneath.
"Go get 'em, boy'. Fuckin' horse will not track. Sits in the park with a shirt under his nose. Finally they get tossED.out by the cops. Who do you think one of the cops is?
(Consults pad.)
ED.Who?
CLEANING WOMAN.I have no idea. (To Art.) You want me to not touch anything today?
ART.No.
CLEANING WOMAN.(To Ed) So I got one for you. What does he mean?
ED.I have no idea.
CLEANING WOMAN.Good for you. (To Art.) You want me to empty the wastebasket?
ART.Is it full?
CLEANING WOMAN.It's not exactly full. There are things in it. Apparently wrappings from foodstuff.
ART.(Vicious cunt.)
CLEANING WOMAN.Alright, alright. I don't like to cause friction. Friction wears you down. That's why they call it
'friction? I come in here every day. I do my job. What am I to you? Old. An old cleaning woman. A woman who just comes in and cleans. (Pause.) I was young once.
ED.Nothing so very extraordinary in that.
CLEANING WOMAN.I like you. You're all right.
ED.Thank you.
CLEANING WOMAN.So how'd you fall in with this sorry sack of shit.
ART.I think that's just about enough.
CLEANING WOMAN.I got more dialogue. (Strikes a pose.)
I've seen a lot in my time. I been about a bit. I was marriED.once
ED.T'll bet there's a story in that.
CLEANING WOMAN.Don't be so sure. I've had experiences.
Loads of 'em: one after the other. Very personal. Must we live in a world where every individual is condemnED.to make the same or awfully fucking similar mistakes? Must we live in a world like that? I hope not and I like to think not.
ART.(This girl can act!)
CLEANING WOMAN.(to audience) I have had many experiences - professional, amateur, and imaginary - in the theatre. (To Art.) So, you want the wastebasket emptied?
ART.You may empty the wastebasket.
CLEANING WOMAN.It's all the same to me.
ART.Well, just leave it full, then, if it gives you such pleasure.
CLEANING WOMAN.I will. And I'm paid to empty it. So find the silly goose in the picture. (Pause.) I see no reason to stay here any longer. (Exits.)
ART.(pause) That was the cleaning woman.
ED.Oh.
ART.(pause) Well, back to work.
ED.Yes. (Taking up pad.)
ART.Busy, busy, busy.
ED.Business.
ART.No problem too large, no problem too small.
ED.No.
ART.All problems just right. It was a lovely day in the park, devoid of human life. A small, nameless squirrel who callED.the park 'home' was gathering nuts. For the winter. When he would eat them. All up.
ED.One fall day a squirrel was in the park looking for nuts to eat later on.
ART.I believe I've said that. He lookED.high and low for those nuts (his satisfaction in the gustation of which would
- instinctively - though not outside the mainstream of traditional Protestant thought - be deferrED.until a later, colder time.) Winter was a'comin on. Already the trees were beginning to shrink from the hideous burden of their lifeless leaves. A morbid time. A time of violence in the face of Famine and of Cold. (Pause.) A time to gather nuts.
ED.(pause) May I try one?
ART.What?
ED.I was asking, could I try one?
ART.Yes, please do.
ED.(taking stage) Once upon a time there was a small and peaceful park, belovED.of men and animals alike. A very nice place. Day and night through the warmer months men would labor over each and every flower, and each tree, shaping... pruning... applying mulch and water in those cases wherein nature had been lax.
ART.Are you daft?
ED.Daft? No. Why do you ask?
ART.I was asking for my own information.
ED.(pause) Shall I continue?
ART.Well, how do you feel? Would you like to?
ED.I felt I was on to something.
ART.On to what?
ED.On to some thread or essence.
ART.On the basis of one paragraph?
ED.Well.
ART.If that's what you felt, then do not let me dissuade you. (Pause. Edmond wilts.) Right. Well, then, enough improvisation. Enough lovemaking. Once there was a bench. No. Wait. Wait. A man comes into a park with no intention of strangling a squirrel, but does so. Two other men, each perfectly conscious of what he is up to, run through the park, one precedED.by the other. And one squirrel sits on a little bench. Um... um
ED.Uh, squirrels!
ART.Yes?
ED.Gatherers of nuts.
ART.Go on.
ED.Harbingers of Autumn.
ART.I think not.
ED.In any case, habitants of the park.
ART.I give you that.
ED.Small, fur-bearing, harmless.
ART.One would hope so.
ED.Men!
ART.(Men.)
ED.Omnivorous, sentient, warm-blooded.
ART.Go on.
ED.THE PARK! Home to one and recreation to the other! (Pause.) How long have you been working on this story?
ART.Ah, time, time, time.
ED.Um.
ART.So, let's just exercise a small bit of control over our horses here. À man leaving the park thinks back on the events of the afternoon. The fight he has witnessED.squirrel he has strangled... 'What does it all mean?" he thinks to himself.
ED.And what does he respond?
ART.Well, wait a second.
ED.Let me try.
ART.What?
ED.Let me try.
ART.I'm sorry, what?
ED.I want to try one!
ART.Well, please do.
ED.An unhappy man with nothing to feED.squirrels comes to the park to forget. Sitting on a bench his efforts are hamperED.by the presence of a squirrel.
ART.Isn't it funny how people will say, 'I'm so hungry I could eat a horse' but never 'I'm so late I could ride a horse?'
ED.Are you hungry?
ART.Not particularly.
ED.Oh. (Pause.) Annoyedly ...
ART.Watch your adverbs.
ED.... he looks at the squirrel.
ART.Aha.
ED.His glance, originally, fillED.with reproach, is softenED.by the mindless creature's happy behavior. (Do we spell that with, or without, a 'u'?)
ART.Without.
ED.Alright. Forgetting his lack of comestibles, he clucks.
ART.(I bet.)
ED.The squirrel approaches. The man moves to stroke the squirrel... And the squirrel - startlED.by far-off cries
- bites the man - hard. Not wishing to appear a fool, the man begins to choke the creature until the squirrel, in a death-like state, releases its grip. The man then leaves the park to staunch his wound and continue in his efforts to forget.
ART.(Or I'm so sensitive I could draw a horse.)
ED.Oblivious to the cries of two dishevellED.gents mixing it up nearby, the squirrel struggles back to consciousness, forces air into its broken lungs, and hops painfully back to its nest in a nearby tree. The next day ...
ART.(Or I'm so petty I could mistreat a horse.)
ED.Mmmm.
ART.(Let's face the facts.)
ED.Its mind full of mute revenge, the squirrel returns to the bench, as does the man. And the process is repeated!
ART.Say, you know, I am a little hungry.
ED.Oh.
ART.So, tell me, Edward, what have you brought for lunch today?
ED.Edmond.
ART.So, tell me, Edmond, what have you brought for lunch today?
ED.Well, I've brought myself a sandwich and some milk.
ART.Milk!
ED.Yes.
ART.Ah, milk.
ED.Um.
ART.I like to drink milk.
ED.So do I.
ART.I like the way it looks.
ED.Uh huh.
ART.And I like the way it tastes.
ED.Silly to drink it otherwise.
ART.I've always thought so.
ED.(pause) Would you like some milk?
ART.Why, yes, I would.
ED.hands ART.carton of milk.
ART.Hideous substance when you come to think of it.
ED.Um. (Takes out sandwich and raises it to his mouth.)
ART.Roastbeef! Is that roastbeef?
ED.Yes.
ART.(staring at sandwich) I knew it! I just knew it.
ED.Would you like some?
ART.Would I like some?
ED.Yes.
ART.Why, yes! (ART.takes the whole sandwich, opens it, looks inside.) Well, well, if it isn't my younger brother just returnED.from college. (Takes a bite.) So, it seems that what we have today is squirrels.
ED.Squirrels.
ART.Filthy beggars.
ED.Um.
ART.But nonetheless, a squirrel comes into the park.
ED.Um.
ART.Best place in the world for 'em. (To Ed.) Have you got a cupcake?
ED.shakes head.
ART.He has some sort of relationship with a man. We follow the two before, during, and after their fateful meeting. Whence they came, what they did, whither they went. Beginning, middle, end. At any point squirrel, or (or
'and/or') man, can be describED.as being closer to or farther from point A (inception) than (or to) point B (conclusion). Dynamism. Plot. Character. Human longing.
The life of the soul expressED.through Art. Nothing less.
ED.Um.
ART.Man meets squirrel. Squirrel bites man. Man kills squirrel. From nothing, to nothing. Watch now. 'Nothing,' rising action. Climax. Falling action. 'Nothing.' Eh? We always clean up when we're done. So, what have we today, eh, Edmond? A man (some man, some unknown creature, some receptacle of the godhead) goes into the park. He sits on a bench by that furry, grey creature, the Squirrel.
ED.The grey squirrel.
ART.He has nothing to feED.it. (God.) He clucks and a squirrel comes over. He moves to pet the squirrel, and the squirrel bites his hand. With his other hand he grabs the squirrel and squeezes it until the squirrel dies. Eh? Eh?
ED.May I ask a question?
ART.That's what you're here for.
ED.What does this mean?
ART.Meaning? Meaning?
ED.Yes.
ART.Ah, meaning! Meaning meaning meaning meaning meaning. Meaning meaning meaning. You ask me about meaning and I respond with gibberish. What kind of a friend am I? Are you sure you don't have a cupcake?
ED.No.
ART.Let me tell you something, Edmond. And if you never hear another thing in your life, remember this. ART.is art.
ED.(pause) You know, I feel that, strictly speaking, that is not quite true.
ART.ART.is not art? (Pause.) Then what is art? (Pause.)
Think about it. I've got to pee. (Delivers from the door.) And while he was away the elves came and fillED.the blank pages with deathless prose. He read them one by one on his return, his heART.full, his bladder empty. 'What elves!' he thought. 'Tonight I shall make them shoes.' (Exits.) Edmond jumps up, grabs cupcake from lunchbag, and stuffs it into his mouth, as CLEANING WOMAN.enters.
CLEANING WOMAN.You wanna' make love?
ED.Well, no. I don't think so, no.
CLEANING WOMAN.That's all right. So how are you doing?
ED.I'm doing fine. (Pause.) How you doing?
CLEANING WOMAN.How should I do? I go around, I got my tools, my mop and my rag, I hum a bit. I listen to the radio in offices where it's applicable. Weather means very little as I work inside. Very few variables. I have a lot of time to myself. (Consults pad.) Sit down in that chair. (ED.sits.) So. Lookit here. (Refers to pad occasionally during this speech.) The future! Planet XZ. 84773. Fourth world in the Goolagong System. Poisonous atmosphere of Clorox. On the surface, weird shit all over the place. A spaceship.
Blasting through the thickenED.mist. Slowing, settling, down into the murk, CHUNK. It has settled. A long pause. (We'll just indicate it.) Who can tell how long in the thickenED.time and timelessness of this once mighty world. Ah, Time, Time! Time, you old albatross.
(Although it is, of course, a little precious to speak of time as being 'old,' huh?).
ED.Um.
CLEANING WOMAN.You young albatross. Time! Rushing to your logical conclusion. (Pause.) Do you like Science Fiction?
ED.Not particularly.
CLEANING WOMAN.Oh. So you going to stick it out here?
ED.I think so, yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, you're working without a net, Bud. Your partner is just jerking himself off, artistically speaking, and has been for years. That's right. We were a number once (though you wouldn't believe it to look at him). But the cat is dead and driED.and hung in the freezer of forgotten dreams. And if you got any sense, you'll hit the fuckin' highway quicker than it takes to tell.
ART.(OSV) Meanwhile, poisED.above the porcelain pissoir, our hero.
CLEANING WOMAN.Oops.
ART.What fantasies, what strange and improbable machinations of fate coursing through his mind. (The distraught mind is not the worst creator.) (Neither is it the best creator.) (It is, perhaps, a creator of variable value.) (Depending, of course, on that which is to be created.) (Among other things.) He finishes. Whips the last lingering drops from his dick, buttons his fly, and proceeds back to the office. 'Plack, plack' go his feet on the marble. 'Good to be getting back to work.' Approaching ​​the office door he hears strange cries within. Cries of pain, of anguish, of the fear of death. Cies of his brand new partner in the clutches of malfaction. An inchoate animal warning buzzes in his brain! ‘You’ve forgotten to wash your hands!’ Back he goes…
CLEANING WOMAN.(A short reprieve.)
ED.Have you workED.here long?
CLEANING WOMAN.Long enough to know better, let me tell you. You know what, everybody talks about the weather, but nobody ever does anything about it, you know? Except him. He never talks about the weather. You wanna' make love? (I askED.you that.) That's okay.
ED.Would you like to read something? (Picks up briefcase.)
CLEANING WOMAN.Sure.
They are looking at Edmond's work, as Arthur enters.
ART.What were you doing?
CLEANING WOMAN.Cleaning the office.
ART.You've already cleanED.it once today.
CLEANING WOMAN.You got a mind like an elephant, you know that?
ART.Um.
CLEANING WOMAN.And the soul of a pawnbroker. You got the soul of some 19th Century Russian pawnbroker and her sister.
ART.Are you still working on that Civil War thing?
CLEANING WOMAN.What can you say about the Civil War? Woman writes Uncle Tom's Cabin, Lincoln frees saves, country splits in two, fights for four years, North wins. Big deal. And, if it happens to decide to appear in print, I hope it remembers who wrote it. And I don't think I'm casting aspersions about the professional honesty of any persons present that just might catch the cars of one not acquaintED.with certain people's past history and be unduly influencED.by it.
ART.(pause) You know, sometimes I feel that you exceED.the prescribED.bounds of your operations.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, you could be right.
ART.I feel I am right.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, can I tell you something?
ART.Yes, please do.
CLEANING WOMAN.Nothing is more important than that.
(Exits.)
ART.Well, where were we?
Interlude One
At rise: It is night time. The CLEANING WOMAN.is alone in the office, creating.
CLEANING WOMAN.The moon. The moonlight. Shining on the ocean right before their tent. Behind them the desert.
Sand. (And a hell of a trip.) Before them the water and another trip. And there they were on the goddamnED.edge. Between two emptinesses. (huh) Between fatigue and resolution. Between effort and effort. On the beach.
(Examines what she's written. Tosses it in wastebasket.) They wore themselves out in the desert. They sat in their tent in the moonlight and lookED.at the ocean they would have to cross. They listenED.to the waves, and the monotonous rhythm of the waves put them to sleep. (Makes a correction on her pad.) They listenED.to the waves and the waves put them to sleep. (Examines what she's written. Tosses it in wastebasket.) They crossED.the desert. They had to cross the ocean. They sat in their tent and thought about their effort. (Scratches it out and corrects what she's written.) They crossED.the desert. They had to cross the ocean. They sat in their tent and didn't think about anything. (Examines
Episode Two
At rise: Arthur and Edmond are in the office collaborating.
ED.Toy boat.
ART.Yes.
ED.Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
ART.You're doing fine.
ED.The words, in effect, become our toyboat.
ART.How about this ...
ED.Real boat.
ART.a man is sitting in the park amongst the squirrels ...
ED.We've done that one.
ART.Not quite so quickly. He sits on a bench. He clucks.
Over comes a squirrel looking for food. The man has no food, because of rising grocery costs. The squirrel cannot understand this, and the man ... out of pity for the poor thing's mindless state - moves to stroke the squirrel.
ED.Toy and real boat.
ART.The squirrel... never having been able to interpret affectionate overtures correctly (and the reason for this: perhaps, material for a whole new story) bites the man and the man, having his first compassionate action in years rebuffed, kills the squirrel. (Pause.) Or words to that effect.
ED.Throughout that long first year of the war Susan and Terry livED.in warmth and comfort in the small apartment overlooking the park.
ART.You're digging your own grave.
ED.Strolling through the park one day, he noticED.her by the fountain.
ART.I'll be damnED.if I don't wonder what we have for lunch today.
ED.Perhaps it was the breeze wafting a trace of her perfume... perhaps she was hailing him ..
ART.Perhaps he was looking for her. Maybe it was his sister. These things happen.
ED.All of a sudden it was like the first time all over again.
It was as if it were the first time. (Pause.) It was the first time. 'You're new here.' he said. Slowly her eyes raisED.to meet his. (He was taller than she.) But her gaze was drawn over his shoulder… over his incredibly low shoulder ... to ... a scene of unspeakable terror .. which she promptly ignored.
ART.Wait a second! This is happening in the park?
ED.Yes.
ART.Hmmm. Good use of space. Man and woman meeting in park. Raises eyes ... looks over shoulder, ignores terror... perhaps glimpses squirrel interesting. Day after day she saw him on his solitary ambles through the park. Though confinED.to a wheelchair, her vision was of the best. (Pause.) Though dependent on crutches she could see quite well. (Pause.) She was nearsighted, and she limped, but neither servED.to diminish her enjoyment of an afternoon with nature.
The two combatants, the funny old man on the bench. the little squirrel (which, being French, she could not help but think of as le petit Ventregris, or alternatively, la petite equerelle')...
ED.Bateau veritable.
ART.Pay attention. Day after day she saw him. What is he thinking of? she wondered. "Does he ever think of me?
What will become of me? How will I meet the vicissitudes of the coming winter? Will find happiness and fulfiment in love? In a new job? Is there more to life than popularity? Does Joe really think I'm pretty or does he just say so, cause he knows that's why I let him fuck me?" (Pause.) Suddenly, her gaze was drawn...
ED.We've done that one.
ART.Suddenly her look was attractED.to a small squirrel sorting through the leaves not three feet from her. Having fixED.her gaze on the creature (not without difficulty), she was struck by its industry. Its healthy fur and bright black eyes. But wait! Around its neck... yes! Circling its neck ... a large rED.welt. As if it had been strangled!
Incompletely strangled! (Pause.) Day after day! (Pause.) By an old man!
ED.Arthur ...
ART.No. I'm hot! I'm hot! And as she stood, musing on the injustice of a system which permits a mindless animal (even one so hideously deformed) to acquire sustenance through looking under leaves, while compelling her to labor in a ...
ED.Do it later.
ART.Even as she so mused... tears running down her cheeks... tears running up and down her cheeks ..: blood congealing on her ankle where the brace had chafED.it raw. (now that really is a bit much) But nonetheless, where was I... uh.
ED.I've got it! The sky darkened, the rain began to fall.
(Pause.) Down. 'Oh no,'
(Hurries through park to street.)
she thought. 'It's raining.'
ART.Out of park?
ED.Wait. She steppED.off the curb in the low thick rain and into the path of an onrushing schoolbus. the driver desperately to see, and not being aidED.any by the windshield wipers swishing so constantly, now one way,
now another.
.. What
was that? A small, rather
European looking woman in glasses standing inevitably in the path of the bus. 'HONK HONK, went the horn. (The children, unaware of the drama through which they were being borne, continuED.to natter of recess and soap-sculpture.)
ART.(I bet.)
ED.Back on the curb she stepped. Her heART.pounding fast. Faster. Too fast! The world began to swim before her eyes. She saw spots! She saw stars! She saw the whole interdigitating mishmosh revealED.in its total complexity, before lapsing - not without regret - into the final state from which there is no furlough. (Pause.) And then she woke up.
ART.I don't like it.
ED.Why not?
ART.Too faggy. (Pause.) Are you feeling well today?
ED.Yes, why do you ask?
ART.Well, you're looking well, I thought I'd ask if you were feeling well.
ED.Mmmm. Quite well, thanks.
ART.You know, every job has its rhythms.
ED.I'm aware of that.
ART.I know you are.
ED.I think I will enjoy my work here.
ART.Mmm.
ED.And not just for the reasons that you think.
ART.No?
ED.I think not, no.
ART.What reasons, then?
ED.Different ones.
ART.What reasons do you think I think?
ED.You think my reasons might be incorrect?
ART.Do 1?
ED.Yes.
ART.Well, yes, I do.
ED.You see!
ART.I do.
ED.That's what I thought.
ART.I know you did.
ED.I do.
ART.I know you do.
ED.I think I know that.
ART.Do you?
ED.Yes, I think I do.
ART.You do?
ED.I think so.
ART.So do I.
ED.You do?
ART.I do.
ED.(pause) Do what? (Pause.) DO WHAT?
ART.(pause) Do you ever think of yourself as a pederas?
ED.No. (Pause.) Do you?
ART.From time to time.
ED.And why is that?
ART.Because it's such a beautiful word. (Pause.) Yes. The Squirrel!
ED.Oh.
ART.A series of embarrassingly personal, thinly-veilED.glimpses into the life of a true rodent. A surreal but somehow touching account of the day-to-day realities of a workaday squirrel. Curtain going aside. A well-lit parlor.
A fire in the grate. Hunting prints. In the center of the table, one incredibly small armchair. (Pause.) Suddenly ... (Pause.)
ED.Yes?
ART.She was there!
ED.Again?
ART.Fresh from a day in the park. Her face a bunch of contradictory impressions. Her figure incredibly je ne sais quoi. Her well-turnED.ankles. Her nicotene-stainED.... fingers. The huge bull mastiff at her side, restrainED.by a simple strand of ... (Pause.) Out she went. Then, a knock at the door. Silence. The knock is repeated... The door opens ... (Pause.)
ED.Who is there?
ART.Formalist. Formal formal formalist!
ED.It's just a word.
ART.And not one to be proud of. Have you learnED.nothing working here?
ED.No.
ART.And what is that supposED.to mean?
ED.What would you like it to mean?
ART."What would T like it to mean? Indeed. There's mine than one fish in the sea.
ED.I don't quite see how that applies.
ART.Think about it.
ED.I shall.
ART.'ll just bet you shall. (Pause.) Edmond. Edmond. Bad.
Eddy. Let's not have friction. Friction wears one down.
(Pause.) You know that. We have a job to do here, and our job is to do it. Eh? Eh? (Pause.) Looky here. Now just take up your pencil now and here we go. Now aren't you happy here? Mmmm? Mmmm? I know you are. These fights are nothing more than that. Isn't that so? Of course it is. You're very good for me. You know that we work well, together, you know that, Eh? Eh? (Pause.) Suuure.
(Pause.) Come on now. (Throughout speech, ART.has been trying to wedge a pencil between Edmond's fingers. He finally succeeds.)
That's better. Yes. I'm sorry for what I said.
ED.I've forgotten all about it.
ART.I know you have, and so have I. So here. The squirrel lay in the shade of a big tree root.
ED.(Restful.)
ART.Playing oppossum. A crowdED.day in the park.
People running. People sitting on benches. The benches themselves. Animals foraging for food, or merely passing time between the sun and sun.
ED.A man must come to grips with artiface.
ART.Clouds wafting overhead
... soil stable underfoot.
The friendly cop on the beat... uh ...
The CLEANING WOMAN.enters.
CLEANING WOMAN.Anybody up for making love?
ART.I think not, no.
CLEANING WOMAN.(to Ed) You?
ED.shakes head.
CLEANING WOMAN.I know, you're busy.
i the whole wide word an it ising here without a care
CLEANING WOMAN.Whatever gets you off.
ART.Haven't you offices to clean?
CLEANING WOMAN.You bet your ass, and that's why they call me the cleaning woman. (They're no fools.) (To Ed.)
So, how you getting on?
ED.We're getting on just fine.
CLEANING WOMAN.I'm glad to hear it. (And this from a woman who's here all night every night and many times til dawn cleaning the offices and generally making herself available.) (Pause.) Well, stuff to do, places to go, floors to mop. (Exits.)
ART.(pause) She was an old woman. StoopED.from years of scrubbing. Degenerate. Licentious. Her filthy hands were ...nah, fuck her. She was young and healthy. DressED.in a simple something-or-other for a nice day in the park ... uh ...
ED.'Boo hoo,' went the little children, huddlED.around the space heater. 'Isn't Daddy coming home tonight?" ART.'Isn't Daddy coming home tonight? askED.the little children. Then, 'Boo hoo.
ED.Ah, yes.
ART.You bet your ass. She was young and healthy.
DressED.in a simple woolen robe.
ED.(Itchy.)
ART.After a filling day in the park. And not too concernED.about the broken furnace, All in all, it was a sort of adventure for her and the kiddies. The high snow had tonight?' askED.the children. "Is he dead, Mom»
probably kept their father lat he deal, dy coming home ED.'Oh, dear' she thought. '1 do hope he was able to see the doctor about his bitten hand.'
ART.Don't try to placate me. (Pause.) And so engrossED.in thought she was, she did not hear the 'Pad Pad Pad of Rusty, their prize Doberman, on the parquet behind her.
She had forgotten to feED.him for the last three weeks running, and from the corner of his jaws hung a red-stainED.rag of someone's Doctor Denton. 'Bark bark" went the dog. (Pause.) Isn't that just like a dog?
Interlude Two
At rise: Edmond and the CLEANING WOMAN.are alone in the office. It is late at night.
Cleaning Woman'... slowly her eyes raisED.to meet his.
"But I will drown," she said. "That, my dear," he retorted,
"is just about what I had in mind." ' (Pause.) Strike out everything from 'That, my dear,' and insert 'Ha ha ha?
You wanna beer?
ED.shakes head.
CLEANING WOMAN.Chapter Two.
ED.Are we using Roman or Arabic numerals for the chapters?
CLEANING WOMAN.What did we do on the first one?
ED.(looks) We wrote it out.
CLEANING WOMAN.We'll use Roman numerals on this one, then.
ED.Right.
CLEANING WOMAN.Chapter Two, A Tale of the Cross.
Ready? (ED.nods.) 'Bubbles. Bubbles bubbles bubbles.
Floating ever-upward. Ever toward the surface. Toward the light. Pretty bubbles full of air. Rising to the heaven of an open sky? (huh?) (Pause.) 'Chains. chains chains chains. Chains of lead. Dragging. Dragging her ever downward. Down through the water to a gooey grave?
(Pause) *Hope. Hope hope hope. Springing eternal in the human breast... uh
ED.(pause) Would you like to go back to work on the Civil War thing?
CLEANING WOMAN.The what?
ED.That piece about the Civil War.
CLEANING WOMAN.Where'd you hear about that?
ED.Well, you were working on one with Arthur, weren't CLEANING WOMAN.That? Oh, that. The north-south number.
ED.Yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, it seems a shame. I mean we already got a running stART.on this one.
ED.Yes ...
CLEANING WOMAN.I mean, you're working on a thing you should continue to work on it until you're done or something stops you. I don't know. Just when it seems you're on to something, all of a sudden, 'Boof,' and what's happening, huh? Shit, I still got two more suites and the hall to do.
ED.Well, let's just try it for a little while...
CLEANING WOMAN.Well...
ED.And if you needed... or wanted
.. some help, later,
with your offices, or the hall, perhaps I could ... (that is, I would be happy to) help you out a bit.
CLEANING WOMAN.A real offer, huh?
ED.You bet.
CLEANING WOMAN.(pause) Nah. Forget it. Takes no time at all. But thanks for asking.
ED.You sure now?
CLEANING WOMAN.Oh, yeah. (Pause.) You working today?
ED.nods head.
CLEANING WOMAN.So, go and get some rest. Go on. I'll see you later. (ED.picks up briefcase and starts to leave.) Hey hey wait. Hey, what about that junk of yours you wantED.me to read? You got it?
ED.(clutching briefcase behind his back) No. I haven't got it with me.
CLEANING WOMAN.That's okay. You bring it in, I'll read it, huh?
ED.You bet.
CLEANING WOMAN.Okay, okay, okay... goodnight.
ED.Goodnight. (Exits.)
CLEANING WOMAN.Okay. (Pause.) So she says, 'Smoke your own salmon, then talk. Cultivate your own garden, then talk. (Always some preliminary to speech.) He misinterprets her. Thinks she's driving him away. It's been known to happen. He joins the Royal Canadian MountED.Police. Finds out the horses are only for show.
Defects. There he is, up in the Bering Straits. Russia just. a few blocks away, all frozen over. He looks back. SlED.dogs! The famous slED.dogs of the Royal Canadian MountED.Police... The lead dog spots him. Woof wooh" Moshee dog. (Just like a dog.) Ous pots the ice he goes.
Mother Russia closer and closer. CRAAAAAK. He looks down, this incredible chasm is opening between his feet. He jumps to the left. Plop! through the ice he goes. Finds himself staring at a walrus. Recognises it instantly. Gets the hell of there. Jumps back on the floe. Cops wait on the shore. Figure he's going to freeze solid, they'll bring him in with tongs. Saris for Russia. One arm freezes. One leg. Other arm. BALM! A frozen statue. Blood starts to freeze. His last thought, he thinks of me. His heART.pumps faster. His crotch gets hot. His armpits. His lymph nodes.
Water flows off him like a duck's back. He is steaming. He is horny. He is free. He rushes onto Mother Russia a free man and gives the Mounties the finger. They give him the finger. He gives them the finger. They give him the finger.
Five months later, the rescue party finds everybody dead from starvation, middle fingers on their right hand pointing 'cross the Bering Strait. (Pause.) So what is the price of animosity?
Episode Three
At rise: Arthur and Edmond are collaborating.
ART.Shit. Shit shit shit shit shit. My pencil is broken. A broken pencil. Eh? The most high-flown plans ... words of import... thoughts of importance. I'm having them.
In my head. And they're staying there because of a simple mechanical malfunction. A simple weakness of wood or graphite. A simple exertion of a pressure on the instrument perhaps greater than that for which it was designed. Can you beat this? Can you beat this with a large stick? I think not. (Pause.) How is the pencil sharpener working?
ED.(tries it) Seems to be operating perfectly.
ART.And there's the rub, one instrument functioning impeccably and the other shatterED.beyond hope of repair.
Eh? I am in the midst of a sentence, the pencil sharpener is operating perfectly, and the pencil breaks!
ED.You're probably overwrought.
ART.Shit. Take this down. It was a brisk and bracing day out in the park...
ED.Just 'brisk' I think.
ART.It was a brisk day in the park. Pigeons wheeling overhead. The scent of. blank... wafting from the (Looks at Ed.)
ED.Well, to a large extent it depends on the scent.
ART.There was an indefinable scent wafting. They were meeting in the park. For the last time. "Well, he though.
'All things have their limit? "Fish and visitors begin to stink after three days. Even the best of fish. (Though they, being dead, are mercifully inurED.to their own putrescence.) (As is the case with visitors, the stink being only figurative.) (As is the case with shit - not being sentient.)' Ah, Love Love Love. It makes the world go round. It makes those same revolutions bearable. (Pause.) And it leads us to philosophise on the process, too! What did she see in him, anyway. Huh? (Pause.) Does it ever seem to you that you're losing your ability to generalize?
ED.Tell it to the Marines.
ART.I disapprove of the Marines.
ED.Then tell it to the Small Business Administration.
ART.Are you feeling alright today?
ED.Quite well, thank you.
ART.Yes. Ah, Time Time Time. You old pee-pee head.
(Pause.) The people yearn for poetry. It's a thankless job.
ED.But not without its compensations.
ART.The terror of an empty sheet of Foolscap. (Pause.) The joy of sexual fulfillment. (Pause.) The embarrassment of fecal incontinence. (Pause.) Words Words Words. The fluid. How of words. One right after the other. (Paus.) Isn't it strange that it is acceptable in polite usage to refer to a witch's tit only for purposes of comparison… go to any social gathering and remark that the weather is as cold as a with the snt o one bate an eye. Ask. What do you think of a witch's tit, and you're brandED.as a boot.
ED.I've got to pee. (Exits.)
Enter the Gleaning Woman.
ART.Does it ever seem to you that you're losing your ability to generalize?
CLEANING WOMAN.Talent isn't everything.
ART.Now wherever did you hear that?
CLEANING WOMAN.You still got your old way with an adjective.
ART.There's more to life than a facility with modifiers. It's possible that I've lost the touch. (Pause.) Once broken, never mended.
CLEANING WOMAN.You think so?
ART.Look at the case of the hymen.
CLEANING WOMAN.The way I see it, it's never too late.
(Pause.) And on the other hand, tough tit. So, how's your pal?
ART.Him? He's not my pal.
CLEANING WOMAN.He's not?
ART.My pal was kidnappED.weeks ago by Martians. He is a cunning imitation sent from Mars to torment and corrupt me.
CLEANING WOMAN.You don't tell me.
ART.I'm afraid I do.
CLEANING WOMAN.So how'd you find out this?
ART.He has malfunctionED.and is behaving erratically.
CLEANING WOMAN.Oh, yeah?
ART.I hope to tell you.
CLEANING WOMAN.(pause) You got any junk around here you’d like to clean up?
ART.No.
CLEANING WOMAN.Okay. (Starts to go.)
ART.Do you remember that afternoon in the park?
CLEANING WOMAN.When?
ART.Long, long ago.
CLEANING WOMAN.Long ago?
ART.Afternoon in park. Sun. Grass. (Perhaps a squirrel.)
Trees... She was there.
CLEANING WOMAN.How we lovED.her.
ART.We were young then.
CLEANING WOMAN.We're still young.
ART.Life was not complex.
CLEANING WOMAN.You got by rhyming 'mustard' and
'custard.'
ART.Nothing mattered.
CLEANING WOMAN.You could still get it up artistically.
ART.She was there.
CLEANING WOMAN.She was still there?
ART.In the time of which I am speaking, yes.
CLEANING WOMAN.And suddenly ... (Looks at Art.) or… gradually… the hell with it. You tell the story.
ART.And suddenly (in the fullness of time) everything had taken on a new meaning. And lost the old meaning. The sun overhead. The cracks in the pavement underfoot (the source of much maternal discomfort) The benches… the trees... many other objects made of wood.
CLEANING WOMAN.How full of life we were.
ART.How full of promise.
CLEANING WOMAN.How lovely she was then.
ART.How young.
CLEANING WOMAN.How young?
ART.A mere fifteen.
CLEANING WOMAN.Enticing jailbait.
ART.How sweet her lips.
CLEANING WOMAN.How bright her eyes.
ART.That vacant stare of hers.
CLEANING WOMAN.She lovED.the movies so.
ART.That child lovED.film.
CLEANING WOMAN.Her honey breath.
ART.Her ignorance of contraceptive technique.
CLEANING WOMAN.'Spank me,' she said, 'for I've been bad.'
ART.The bench... her bench.
CLEANING WOMAN.She lovED.that bench.
ART.She lovED.to sit on it.
CLEANING WOMAN.That shapely derrière.
ART.So young ... so full of promise.
CLEANING WOMAN.Her face on Christmas morning.
ART.Her leg on Labor Day.
CLEANING WOMAN.The inconsistency in her treatment of service personnel...
ART.Were we too harsh?
CLEANING WOMAN.Who the fuck knows?
ART.Ah, Time Time Time. Only the past is susceptible to change. The future belongs to those who prepare for it.
The past, to everyone.
CLEANING WOMAN.That's not bad.
ART.You really think so?
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, I don't know. I said it, if that's any indication.
ART.Are you baiting me?
CLEANING WOMAN.I don't think so.
ART.Well, that's what it sounds like to me.
CLEANING WOMAN.Bite on a bullet. (Pause.) Lookit, couldn't we be pals?
ART.I feel that I could be a 'pal.'
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, let's.be pals then.
ART.I haven't had a pal since gradeschool.
CLEANING WOMAN.Well, I will be your pal.
ART.And I will be your pal.
CLEANING WOMAN.And I will be yours.
ART.I don't believe you.
CLEANING WOMAN.Go to Paris and suffer. (Pause.) Well, lookit I've enjoyED.this. (Starts to go.)
ART.Wait. Wait. Flirt with me a minute, will you?
CLEANING WOMAN.Where did you get that shirt?
ART.Do you like it?
CLEANING WOMAN.Very much.
ART.It's just an old shirt.
CLEANING WOMAN.It looks so well on you.
ART.Why, thank you.
CLEANING WOMAN.Not at all. (Pause. Exits.)
ART.Form Form Form. Form and the use of tools.
Precision, restraint, control. (ED.enters.) Substance.
Meaning. The meaning of a thing. What it means. The why of it. Walking. Beckoning. Biting. being bitten ... The acs of biting and of being bitten. Hopping and hoping-(perhaps) Strangling and being strangled. And the acts of perceiving those acts... The contract between oppressED.and oppressor. And who is who ... and why.
ED.What are you talking about?
ART.Just speaking in general.
ED.I'm unhappy here.
ART.Why is that?
ED.(pause) We write the same thing all the time.
ART.You think that I don't know that?
ED.I know you know that.
ART.I know you do.
ED.And why do we do it?
ART.And why do we do it?
ED.Why do you do it?
ART.Why do I do it?
ED.Yes.
ART.You'd be happier if we wrote something else? Is it the squirrels you object to? To what is it that you object?
How can I make you happy?
ED.You're very overbearing.
ART.Mmm.
ED.And I don't like it.
ART.Well who would?
ED.I feel ...
ART.Yes?
ED.I feel .. •
ART.Is it the squirrels that you object to? If that is it, please tell me. If that's what you object to we can move along to something else. Do you think that I'm fixated? Is that what you think? Do you think that? I am not tiED.to any one specific animal. Can you truly feel that I'm that limited? When you've been in the business as long as I you will not feel that way. There's more to life than a facility with modifiers. There's more to lite than a flash in the pan. Some Johnnie-Come-Lately ... and I try to make him happy... comes in here and I nurture him beneath my wing, give him the benefit of my experience, my expertise, my ... uh ...
ED.Exuberance.
ART.And there you are, that's just my point. Exuberance indeed! When have you known me to be exuberant?
Certainly the word begins with 'ex' but what of it, eh?
What of it? Form form form. And you tell me you're unhappy here. Why? Can you tell me why? I'm not unhappy here.
ED.I'm sick of the squirrels.
ART.You're sick of squirrels.
ED.Yes, I am.
ART.Then we'll just write something else then, if it makes you so happy. There's more than one fish in the sea.
ED.I don't quite see how that applies.
ART.You wouldn't.
ED.I don't.
ART.Then just keep your mouth shut and shut up.
Pause. Arthur fishes in wastebasket behind Edmond's back - he takes out and reads the sheets the CLEANING WOMAN.has discardED.previously, and dictates the following. 
Take this down:
The moon. The moonlight.
The moonlight shone on the ocean right in front of their tent. (eh?)
They had just crossED.the desert. A desert crossing lay behind them.
An ocean crossing lay in front of them as they would have to cross the ocean.
They lay in the space between the two, their limbs weary with fatigue, and, by and by, they fell right off to sleep.
Now type that up, you sonofabitch, and get out of here.
I'll see you tomorrow in the morning. (He exits).
Interlude Three
At rise: The CLEANING WOMAN.and Edmond are creating. It is late at night.
CLEANING WOMAN.I almost saw a dog today that lookED.like a small horse.
ED.(pause) We've stoppED.working on the squirrels.
CLEANING WOMAN.Yeah?
ED.We're writing about geese.
CLEANING WOMAN.Ahhhhhh. A change is as good as a rest.
ED.Yes. Well, it seems to me that forward motion is an indication of progress. (Pause.) It seems to me that many times artistic achievement is difficult to measure. (Pause.) Artistic development is sometimes difficult to perceive.
(Pause.) That sometimes that perception is not so crucial (Pause.) to the artist. (Pause.) That sometimes, rather than being productive... it has a potential for counterproductivity. Introspection rase That a period of . work ... untemperED.by harrassing elements of ... introspective examination can be beneficial. (Pause) Not the least potential accruing benefits, of this being pedantic.
(Pause.) That is, pedagogic. That is hitt it is potentially not the least valuable aspect of this hiatic (non-introspective) period that it becomes, eventually, instructive. To the creator. (Pause. I mean, lookit, he says
'Here! See how far I've come, and because I did the work and didn't worry those elements once only philosophic and ideal about which I wastED.so much thought have become osmosED.into my being as technique and are behind me. (Pause.) This is how it seems to me. It seems to me that this is the way it is. That there is a strength (not to be scornED.at) in technique. That the true employment of inspiration is in formal endeavors where the inspiration can take form. We have been working. It isn't as if we'd been idle. (Pause.)
We sat in our tent in the moonlight and watchED.a flight of geese.
They flew in close formation.
Over the desert.
Making one drowsy.
And watchED.us fall asleep.
I wrote that.
Episode Four
At rise: Arthur and Edmond are collaborating.
ED.Geese.
ART.Yes.
ED.Geese Geese Geese. Close in formation. Promoting order,
ART.Making one drowsy.
ED.Up up up in the sky so blue.
ART.(He's hot today.)
ED.Flying flying flying ...
ART.(he says everything three times)
ED.... high. How far to the bottom of the page?
ART.Half an inch.
ED.Yes. Um...
ART.They turn to each other... 'Dear, Dear,' he says.
I almost saw a squirrel today that lookED.like a small
dog…
ED.Toss it out.
ART.Yes?
ED.Toss it out, be free. Now pay attention. Geese.
ART.Yes?
ED.Geese geese geese. Flying over park and lake. Over sand and water. Over sea and shore, young and old, lion and tiger. Searching searching searching. Searching to be
free.
Long pause in which they look at each other with satisfaction.
Type it up and let's go home.
Epilogue
At rise: Edmond and Arthur freeze at the end of Episode Four. The CLEANING WOMAN.enters. She glances at her pad.
Cleaning Woman
Squirrels. (Squirrels.)
Gatherers of nuts.
Harbingers of autumn.
Clucking and strangling.
Strangling and being strangled.
Rushing to your logical conclusion.
Searching to be free.
She assesses what she's written and throws it in the wastebasket.
She nods to the audience.
