# DPO_HSE_Project1_Pinteresque-language
Pinteresque language - a dramatic style characterized by menacing ambiguity, long pauses, and seemingly trivial, colloquial dialogue that masks deep underlying tension. 
This work is concentrated on the main features of the style and tries to find out whether Pinter's work are truly unique because of these attributes. 
# The topic: "The analysis and comparison of Pinteresque language"
The current research is devoted to the issue of the Pinteresque language as a distinctive phenomenon in the world of literature and linguistics. Harold Pinter — an English play writer, whose writings are provided with unique features, distinguished by several patterns. The way the author uses language confuses the readers and creates a new reality, where words and speech mean nothing. Supported by linguistic and sociolinguistic issues, works of Pinter challenges the conventional nature of dialogues and their purpose in the communication. Hesitations and silence gain power in the negotiations, ruining the common understanding of conversations between individuals. Thus, the paper handles particular examples of how the Pinteresque language is formed.

The analysis is based on the comparison of Pinter's plays and his colleagues' writings.
