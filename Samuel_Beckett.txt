Expanse of scorched grass rising centre to low mound. Gentle slopes down to front and either side of stage. Back an abrupter fall to stage level. Maximum of simplicity and symmetry. 
Blazing light.
Very pompier trompe-l'oeil backcloth' to represent unbroken plain and sky receding to meet in far distance.
Embedded up to above her waist in exact centre of mound, WINNIE. About fifty, well-preserved, blonde for preference, plump, arms and shoulders bare, low bodice, big bosom, pearl necklace." She is discovered sleeping, her arms on the ground before her, her head on her arms. Beside her on ground to her left a capacious black bag, shopping variety, and to her right a collapsible collapsed parasol, beak of handle emerging from sheath.
To her right and rear, lying asleep on ground, hidden by mound,
WILLIE. Long pause. A bell rings? piercingly, say ten seconds, stops. She does not move. Pause. Bell more piercingly, say five seconds. She wakes. Bell stops. She raises her head, gazes front. Long pause.
She straightens up, lays her hands flat on ground, throws back her head and gazes at zenith. Long pause.
WINNIE. (gazing at zenith). Another heavenly day. (Pause.
Head back level, eyes front, pause. She clasps hands to breast, closes eyes. Lips move in inaudible prayer, say ten seconds.
Lips still. Hands remain clasped. Low.) For Jesus Christ sake Amen.18 (Eyes open, hands unclasp, return to mound.

(Stops polishing, raises face to sky, pause, head back level, resumes polishing, stops polishing, cranes back to her right and down.) Ноо-оо! (Pause. Tender smile as she turns back front and resumes polishing. Smile off.)

genuine pure… —(looks closer)-genuine pure ... (Takes off spectacles, lays them and brush down, gazes before her.) Old things. (Pause.) Old eyes. (Long pause.) On, Winnie, (She casts about her, sees parasol, considers it at length, takes it up and develops from sheath a handle of surprising length. Holding butt of parasol in right hand she cranes back and down to her right to hang over WILLIE.) Hoo-00! (Pause.) Willie! (Pause.) Wonderful gift.† (She strikes down at him with beak of parasol.) Wish I had it. (She strikes again. The parasol slips from her grasp and falls behind mound. It is immediately restored to her by WILLIE's invisible hand.)
Thank you, dear. (She transfers parasol to left hand, turns back front and examines right palm.) Damp. (Returns parasol to right hand, examines left palm.) Ah well, no worse. (Head up, cheerfully.) No better, no worse, no change. (Pause. Do.) No pain. (Cranes back to look down at WILLIE, holding parasol by butt as before.) Don't go off on me again now dear will you please, I may need you. (Pause.) No hurry, no hurry, just don't curl up on me again. (Turns back front, lays down parasol, examines palms together, wipes them on grass.) Perhaps a shade off colour just the same. (Turns to bag, rummages in it, brings out revolver, holds it up, kisses it rapidly, puts it back, rummages, brings out almost empty bottle of red medicine, turns back front, looks for spectacles, puts them on, reads label.) Loss of spirits... lack of keenness ... want of appetite... infants... children ... adults... six level... tablespoonfuls daily- (head up, smile) the old style-(smile off, head down, reads)-daily… before and after ... meals ... instantaneous ... (looks closer) ... improvement. (Takes off spectacles, lays them down, holds up bottle at arm's length to see level, unscrews cap, " swigs it off head well back, tosses cap and bottle away in WILLIE's direction. Sound of breaking glass.) Ah that's better! (Turns to bag, rummages in it, brings out lipstick, turns back front, examines lipstick.) Running out. (Looks for spectacles.) Ah well. (Puts on spectacles, looks for mirror.)
Mustn't complain. (Takes up mirror, starts doing lips.) What is that wonderful line? (Lips.) Oh fleeting joys-(lips)-oh something lasting woe: (Lips. She is interrupted by dis-
turbance31 from WILLIE. He is sitting up. She lowers lipstick and mirror and cranes back and down to look at him. Pause.
Top back of WILLIE's bald head, trickling blood, rises to view above slope, comes to rest. WINNIE pushes up her spectacles. Pause. His hand appears with handkerchief, spreads it on skull, disappears. Pause. The hand appears with boater, club ribbon,36 settles it on head, rakish angle, disappears. Pause. WINNIE cranes a little further back and down.) Slip on your drawers, dear, before you get singed.
(Pause.) No? (Pause.) Oh I see, you still have some of that stuff left. (Pause.) Work it well in, dear. (Pause.) Now the other,* (Pause. She turns back front, gazes before her. Happy expression.) Oh this is going to be another happy day!
(Pause. Happy expression off. She pulls down spectacles and resumes lips. WILLIE opens newspaper, hands invisible. Tops of yellow sheets appear on either side of his head. WINNIE finishes lips, inspects them in mirror held a little further away.)
Ensign crimson. (WILLIE turns page. WINNIE lays down lipstick and mirror, turns towards bag.) Pale flag. (WILLIE turns page. WINNIE rummages in bag, brings out small ornate brimless hat with crumpled feather, turns back front, straightens hat, smooths feather, raises it towards head.
arrests gesture as WILLIE reads.)
WILLIE. His Grace and Most Reverend Father in God Dr.
Carolus Hunteral dead in tub.
(Pause.)
WINNIE. (gazing front, hat in hand, tone of fervent reminiscence.)
Charlie Hunter! (Pause.) I close my eyes —(she takes off spectacles and does so, hat in one hand, spectacles in other, WILLIE turns page)—and am sitting on his knees again, in the back garden at Borough Green,† under the horse-beech. (Pause. She opens eyes, puts on spectacles, fiddles with hat.) Oh the happy memories!
(Pause. She raises hat towards head, arrests gesture as WILLIE reads.)
WILLIE. Opening for smart youth.
(Pause. She raises hat towards head, arrests gesture, takes off spectacles, gazes front, hat in one hand, spectacles in other.)
WINNIE. My first ball! (Long pause.) My second ball! (Long pause. Closes eyes.) My first kiss! (Pause. WILLIE turns page.
WINNIE opens eyes.) A Mr. Johnson, or Johnston, or perhaps I should say Johnstone. Very bushy moustache, to very tawny. (Reverently.) Almost ginger! (Pause.) Within a toolshed, though whose I cannot conceive. We had no toolshed and he most certainly had no toolshed. (Closes eyes.)
I see the piles of pots. (Pause.) The tangles of bast.* (Pause.) The shadows deepening among the rafters. (Pause. She opens eyes, puts on spectacles, raises hat towards head, arrests gesture as WILLIE reads.)
WILLIE. Wanted bright boy.
(Pause. WINNIE puts on hat hurriedly, looks for mirror.
WILLIE turns page. WINNIE takes up mirror, inspects hat, lays down mirror, turns towards bag. Paper disappears.
WINNIE rummages in bag, brings out magnifying-glass, turns back front, looks for toothbrush. Paper reappears, folded, and begins to fan WILLIE's face, hand invisible. WINNIE takes up toothbrush and examines handle through glass.)
WINNIE. Fully guaranteed ... (WILLIE stops fanning) ... genuine pure ... (Pause. WILLIE resumes fanning. WINNIE looks closer, reads.) Fully guaranteed ... (WILLIE stops fanning) ... genuine pure ... Pause. WiLLIE resumes fanning.
WINNIE lays down glass and brush, takes handkerchief from bodice, takes off and polishes spectacles, puts on spectacles, looks for glass, takes up and polishes glass, lays down glass, looks for brush, takes up brush and wipes handle, lays down brush, puts handkerchief back in bodice, looks for glass, takes up glass, looks for brush, takes up brush and examines handle through glass.) Fully guaranteed
... (WILLIE stops fanning)
... genuine pure... (pause, WILLIE resumes fanning) ... hog's ... (WILLIE stops fanning, pause) ... setae. (Pause.
WINNIE lays down glass and brush, paper disappears, WINNIE takes off spectacles, lays them down, gazes front.) Hog's setae.† (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, that not a day goes by—(smile)—to speak in the old stylet-smile off)-hardly a day, without some addition to one's knowledge however trifling, the addition I mean, provided one takes the pains. (WILLIE's hand reappears with a postcard which he examines close to eyes.) And if for some strange reason no further pains are possible, why then just close the eyes—(she does so)—and wait for the day to come— (opens eyes)—the happy day to come when flesh melts at so many degrees and the night of the moon has so many hundred hours. (Pause.) That is what I find so comforting when I lose heart and envy the brute beast. a (Turning towards WILLIE.) I hope you are taking in—(She sees postcard, bends lower.) What is that you have there, Willie, may I see? (She reaches down with hand and WILLIE hands her card. The hairy forearm appears above slope, raised in gesture of giving, the hand open to take back, and remains in this position till card is returned. WINNIE turns back front and examines card.) Heavens what are they up to! (She looks for spectacles," puts them on and examines card.)† No but this is just genuine pure filth !50 (Examines card.) Make any nice-minded person want to vomit! (Impatience of WILLIE's fingers. She looks for glass, takes it up and examines card through glass. Long pause.) What does that creature in the background think he's doing? (Looks closer.) Oh no really!
(Impatience of fingers. Last long look. She lays down glass, takes edge of card between right forefinger and thumb, averts head, takes nose between left forefinger and thumb.) Pah!
(Drops card.) Take it away! (WILLIE's arm disappears. His hand reappears immediately, holding card. WINNIE takes off spectacles, lays them down, gazes before her. During what follows WILLIE continues to relish card, varying angles and distance from his eyes.) Hog's setae. (Puzzled expression.) What exactly is a hog?51 (Pause. Do.) A sow of course I know, but a hog... Puzzled expression off.) Oh well what does it matter, that is what I always say, it will come back, that is what I find so wonderful, all comes back. (Pause.) AllP (Pause.) No, not all. (Smile.) No no. (Smile off.) Not quite. (Pause.) A part. (Pause.) Floats up, one fine day, out of the blue. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful.
(Pause. She turns towards bag.† Hand and card disappear.
She makes to rummage in bag, arrests gesture.) No. (She turns back front. Smile.) No no. (Smile off.) Gently Winnie.
(She gazes front. WILLIE's hand reappears, takes off hat, disappears with hat.) What then? (Hand reappears, takes handkerchief from skull, disappears with handkerchief.
Sharply, as to one not paying attention.) Winnie! (WILLIE bows head out of sight.) What is the alternative? (Pause.)
What is the al—(WILLIE blows nose loud and long, 52 head and hands invisible. She turns to look at him. Pause. Head reappears. Pause. Hand reappears with handkerchief, spreads it on skull, disappears. Pause. Hand reappears with boater, settles it on head, rakish angle, disappears. Pause.) Would I had let you sleep on. (She turns back front. Intermittent plucking at grass, head up and down, to animate following.)
Ah yes, if only I could bear to be alone, I mean prattle away with not a soul to hear. (Pause.) Not that I flatter myself you hear much, no Willie, God forbid. (Pause.)
Days perhaps when you hear nothing. (Pause.) But days too when you answer. (Pause.) So that I may say at all times, even when you do not answer and perhaps hear nothing, something of this is being heard, I am not merely talking to myself, that is in the wilderness, is a thing I could never bear to do—for any length of time. (Pause.) That is what enables me to go on, go on talking that is. i (Pause.) Whereas if you were to die—(smile)—to speak in the old style—(smile off)—or go away and leave me, then what would I do, what could I do, all day long, I mean between the bell for waking and the bell for sleep? (Pause.) Simply gaze before me with compressed lips.55 (Long pause while she does so. No more plucking.) Not another word as long as I drew breath, nothing to break the silence of this place.
(Pause.) Save possibly, now and then, every now and then, a sigh into my looking-glass. (Pause.) Or a brief... gale of laughter, should I happen to see the old joke again.
(Pause. Smile appears, broadens and seems about to culminate in laugh when suddenly replaced by expression of anxiety.)
My hair! (Pause.) Did I brush and comb my hair? (Pause.) I may have done. (Pause.) Normally I do. (Pause.) There is so little one can do. (Pause.) One does it all. (Pause.) All one can. (Pause.) 'Tis only human. (Pause.) Human nature.
(She begins to inspect mound, looks up.) Human weakness.
(She resumes inspection of mound, looks up.) Natural weakness. (She resumes inspection of mound.) I see no comb.
(Inspects.) Nor any hairbrush. (Looks up. Puzzled expression.
She turns to bag, rummages in it.) The comb is here. (Back front. Puzzled expression. Back to bag. Rummages.) The brush is here. (Back front. Puzzled expression.) Perhaps I put them back, after use. (Pause. Do.) But normally I do not put things back, after use, no, I leave them lying about and put them back all together, at the end of the day.
(Smile.) To speak in the old style. (Pause.) The sweet old style.56 (Smile off.) And yet... I seem ... to remember...
(Suddenly careless.) Oh well, what does it matter, that is what I always say, I shall simply brush and comb them later on, purely and simply, I have the whole- (Pause, Puzzled.) Them? (Pause.) Or it? (Pause.) Brush and comb it? (Pause.) Sounds improper somehow. (Pause. Turning a little towards WILLIE.) What would you say, Willie? (Pause.
Turning a little further.) What would you say, Willie, speaking of your hair, them or it? (Pause.) The hair on your head, I mean. (Pause. Turning a little further.) The hair on your head, Willie, what would you say speaking of the hair on your head, them or it?
(Long pause.)
WILLIE. It. 57
WINNIE. (turning back front, joyful). Oh you are going to talk to me today, this is going to be a happy day! (Pause. Joy off.)
Another happy day. (Pause.) Ah well, where was I, my hair, yes, later on, I shall be thankful for it later on. (Pause.) I have my-(raises hands to hat)-yes, on, my hat on— (lowers hands)—I cannot take it off now. (Pause.) To think there are times one cannot take off one's hat, not if one's life were at stake. Times one cannot put it on, times one cannot take it off. (Pause.) How often I have said, Put on your hat now, Winnie, there is nothing else for it, take off your hat now, Winnie, like a good girl, it will do you good, and did not. (Pause.) Could not.8 (Pause. She raises hand, frees a strand of hair from under hat, draws it towards eye, squints at it, lets it go, hand down.) Golden you called it, that day, when the last guest was gone—(hand up in gesture of raising a glass)—to your golden ... may it never ... (voice breaks) ... may it never ... (Hand down. Head down. Pause. Low.) That day. (Pause. Do.) What day?
(Pause. Head up. Normal voice.) What now? (Pause.) Words fail, there are times when even they fail. (Turning a little towards WILLIE.) Is that not so, Willie? (Pause. Turning a little further.) Is not that so, Willie, that even words fail, at times? (Pause. Back front.) What is one to do then, until they come again? Brush and comb the hair, if it has not been done, or if there is some doubt, trim the nails if they are in need of trimming, these things tide one over. (Pause.)
That is what I mean. (Pause.) That is all I mean. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, that not a day goes byf
-(smile) —to speak in the old style— (smile off)
-without
some blessing —(WILLIE collapses behind slope, his head disappears, WINNIE turns towards event) in disguise. (She cranes back and down.) Go back into your hole now, Willie, you've exposed yourself enough. (Pause,) Do as I say, Willie, don't lie sprawling there in this hellish sun, go back into your hole. (Pause.) Go on now, Willie. (WILLIE invisible starts crawling left towards hole.) That's the man.
(She follows his progress with her eyes.) Not head first, stupid, how are you going to turn? (Pause.) That's it ... right round... now ... back in. (Pause.) Oh I know it is not easy, dear, crawling backwards, but it is rewarding in the end. (Pause.) You have left your vaseline behind. (She watches as he crawls back for vaseline.) The lid! (She watches as he crawls back towards hole. Irritated.) Not head first, I tell you! (Pause.) More to the right. (Pause.) The right, I said. (Pause. Irritated.) Keep your tail down, can't you! (Pause.) Now. (Pause.) There! (All these directions loud. Now in her normal voice, still turned towards him.)
Can you hear me? (Pause.) I beseech you, Willie, just yes or no, can you hear me, just yes or nothing.
(Pause.)
WILLIE. Yes.
WINNIE. (turning front, same voice). And now?
WILLIE. (irritated). Yes.
WINNIE. (less loud). And now?
WILLIE. (more irritated). Yes.
WINNIE. (still less loud). And now?† (A little louder.) And now?
WILLIE. (violently). Yes!
WINNIE. (same voice). Fear no more the heat ' the sun.60
(Pause.) Did you hear that?
WILLIE. (irritated). Yes.
WINNIE. (same voice). What? (Pause.) What?
WILLIE. (more irritated). Fear no more.
(Pause.)
WINNIE. (same voice). No more what? (Pause.) Fear no more
what?
WILLIE. (violently). Fear no more!
WINNIE. (normal voice, gabbled).61 Bless you Willie I do appreciate your goodness I know what an effort it costs you, now you may relax I shall not trouble you again unless I am obliged to, by that I mean unless I come to the end of my own resources which is most unlikely, just to know that in theory you can hear me even though in fact you don't is all I need, just to feel you there within earshot and conceivably on the qui vive is all I ask, not to say anything I would not wish you to hear or liable to cause you pain, not to be just babbling away on trust as it is were not knowing and something gnawing at me. (Pause for breath.) Doubt. (Places index and second finger on heart area, moves them about, brings them to rest.) Here. (Moves them slightly.)
Abouts. (Hand away.) Oh no doubt the time will come when before I can utter a word I must make sure you heard the one that went before and then no doubt another come another time when I must learn to talk to myself a thing I could never bear to do such wilderness.62 (Pause.) Or gaze before me with compressed lips. (She does so.) All day long. (Gaze and lips again.) No. (Smile.) No no. (Smile off. There is of course the bag. (Turns towards it.) There will always be the bag. (Back front.) Yes, I suppose so.
(Pause.) Even when you are gone, Willie. (She turns a little towards him.) You are going, Willie, aren't you? (Pause.
Louder.) You will be going soon, Willie, won't you? (Pause.
Louder.) Willie! (Pause. She cranes back and down to look at him.) So you have taken off your straw, that is wise. (Pause.) You do look snug, I must say, with your chin on your hands and the old blue eyes like saucers in the shadows.
(Pause.) Can you see me from there I wonder, I still wonder. (Pause.) No? (Back front.) Oh I know it does not follow when two are gathered together"-(faltering) - in this way-(normal) — that because one sees the other the other sees the one, life has taught me that ... too. (Pause.) Yes, life I suppose, there is no other word.† (She turns a Little towards him.) Could you see me, Willie, do you think, from where you are, if you were to raise your eyes in my direction? (Turns a little further.) Lift up your eyes to me, Willie, 61 and tell me can you see me, do that for me, I'll lean back as far as I can.† (Does so. Pause.) No? (Pause.) Well never mind. (Turns back painfully front.) The earth is very tight today, can it be I have put on flesh, I trust not.
(Pause. Absently, eyes lowered.) The great heat possibly.
(Starts to pat and stroke ground.) All things expanding, some more than others. (Pause. Patting and stroking.) Some less. (Pause. Do.) Oh I can well imagine what is passing through your mind, it is not enough to have to listen to the woman, now I must look at her as well. (Pause. Do.) Well it is very understandable. (Pause. Do.) Most under-standable. (Pause. Do.) One does not appear to be asking a great deal, indeed at times it would seem hardly possible-(voice breaks, falls to a murmur)—to ask less—of a fellow-creature-to put it mildly-whereas actually-when you think about it-look into your heart-see the other— what he needs—peace—to be left in peace-then perhaps the moon-all this time-asking for the moon. (Pause.
Stroking hand suddenly still. Lively.) Oh I say, what have we here? (Bending head to ground, incredulous.) Looks like life of some kind! (Looks for spectacles, puts them on, bends closer. Pause.) An emmet!65 (Recoils. Shrill.) Willie, an emmet, a live emmet! (Seizes magnifying-glass, bends to ground again, inspects through glass.) Where's it gone?
(Inspects.) Ah! (Follows its progress through grass.) Has like a little white ball in its arms.® (Follows progress. Hand still. Pause.) It's gone in. (Continues a moment to gaze at spot through glass, then slowly straightens up, lays down glass, takes off spectacles and gases before her, spectacles in hand, Finally.) Like a little white ball.
(Long pause. Gesture to lay down spectacles.)
WILLIE. Eggs.
WINNIE. (arresting gesture). What?
(Pause.)
WILLIE. Eggs. (Pause. Gesture to lay down glasses.) Formica-
tion. 67
WINNIE. (arresting gesture). What?
(Pause.)
WILLIE. Formication.
(Pause. She lays down spectacles, gazes before her. Finally.)
WINNIE. (murmur). God. (Pause. WILLIE laughs quietly. After a moment she joins in. They laugh quietly together. WILLIE stops. She laughs on a moment alone. WILLIE joins in. They laugh together. She stops. WILLIE laughs on a moment alone.
He stops. Pause. Normal voice.) Ah well what a joy in any case to hear you laugh again, Willie, I was convinced I never would, you never would. (Pause.) I suppose some people might think us a trifle irreverent, but I doubt it.
(Pause.) How can one better magnify the Almighty than by sniggering with him at his little jokes, particularly the poorer ones? (Pause.) I think you would back me up there, Willie. (Pause.) Or were we perhaps diverted by two quite different things? (Pause.) Oh well, what does it matter, that is what I always say, so long as one ... you know ... what is that wonderful line... laughing wild... something something laughing wild amid severest woe.68 (Pause.) And now? (Long pause.) Was I lovable once, Willie?
(Pause.) Was I ever lovable? (Pause.) Do not misunderstand my question, I am not asking you if you loved me, we know all about that, I am asking you if you found me lovable-at one stage. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) You can't?
(Pause.) Well I admit it is a teaser. And you have done more than your bit already, for the time being, just lie back now and relax, I so all not trouble you again unless t am compelled to, just to know you are there within hearing and conceivably on the semi-alert is ... er ... paradise chow, (Pause.) The day is now well advanced. (Smile.) To speak in the old style. (Smile off. And yet it is perhaps a little soon for my song. (Pause.) To sing too soon is a great mistake, I find. (Turning towards bag.) There is of course the bag. (Looking at bag.) The bag. (Back front.)
Could I enumerate its contents? (Pause.) No. (Pause.)
Could I, if some kind person were to come along and ask, What all have you got in that big black bag, Winnie? give an exhaustive answer? (Pause.) No. (Pause.) The depths in particular, who knows what treasures. (Pause.) What comforts. (Turns to look at bag.) Yes, there is the bag.
(Back front.) But something tells me, Do not overdo the bag, Winnie, make use of it of course, let it help you ... along, when stuck, by all means, but cast your mind forward, something tells me, cast your mind forward, Winnie, to the time when words must fail—(she closes eyes, pause, opens eyes—and do not overdo the bag. (Pause. She turns to look at bag.) Perhaps just one quick dip. (She turns back front, closes eyes, throws out left arm, plunges hand in bag and brings out revolver. Disgusted.) You again! (She opens eyes, brings revolver front and contemplates it. She weighs it in her palm.) You'd think the weight of this thing would bring it down among the ... last rounds. But no.
It doesn't. Ever uppermost, like Browning.? (Pause.)
Brownie... (Turning a little towards WILLIE.) Remember Brownie, Willie? (Pause.) Remember how you used to keep on at me to take it away from you? Take it away, Winnie, take it away, before I put myself out of my misery. (Back front. Derisive.) Your misery! (To revolver.) Oh I suppose it's a comfort to know you're there, but I'm tired of you.
(Pause.) I'll leave you out, that's what I'll do. (She lays revolver on ground to her right.) There, that's your home from this day out. (Smile.) The old style! (Smile off.) And now? (Long pause.) Is gravity what it was, Willie, I fancy not. (Pause.) Yes, the feeling more and more that if I were not held-(gesture) — in this way, I would simply float up into the blue.?? (Pause.) And that perhaps some day the earth will yield and let me go, the pull is so great, yes, crack all round me and let me out. (Pause.) Don't you ever have that feeling, Willie, of being sucked up? (Pause.)
Don't you have to cling on sometimes, Willie? (Pause. She turns a little towards him.) Willie.
(Pause.)
WILLIE. Sucked up?73
WINNIE. Yes love, up into the blue, like gossamer. (Pause.) No?
(Pause.) You don't? (Pause.) Ah well, natural laws, natural laws, I suppose it's like everything else, it all depends on the creature you happen to be. All I can say for my part is that for me they are not what they were when I was young and ... foolish and ... (faltering, head down) ... beautiful ... possibly ... lovely ... in a way ... to look at. (Pause.
Head up.) Forgive me, Willie, sorrow keeps breaking in.
(Normal voice.) Ah well what a joy in any case to know you are there, as usual, and perhaps awake, and perhaps taking all this in, some of all this, what a happy day for me ... it will have been. (Pause.) So far. (Pause.) What a blessing nothing grows, imagine if all this stuff were to start growing. (Pause.) Imagine. (Pause.) Ah yes, great mercies.† (Long pause.) I can say no more. (Pause.) For the moment.
(Pause. Turns to look at bag. Back front. Smile.) No no.
(Smile off. Looks at parasol.) I suppose I might —(takes up parasol)-
—yes, I suppose I might ... hoist this thing now.
(Begins to unfurl it. Following punctuated by mechanical difficulties overcome.) One keeps putting off—-putting up— for fear of putting up too soon—and the day goes by—quite by—without one's having put up-at all. (Parasol now fully open. Turned to her right she twirls it idly this way and that.) Ah yes, so little to say, so little to do, and the fear so great, certain days, of finding oneself... left, with hours still to run, before the bell for sleep, and nothing more to say, nothing more to do, that the days go by, certain days go by, quite by, the bell goes, and little or nothing said, little or nothing done. (Raising parasol.) That is the danger. (Turning front.) To be guarded against. (She gazes front, holding up parasol with right hand. Maximum pause.) I used to perspire freely. (Pause.) Now hardly at all. (Pause.) The heat is much greater. (Pause.) The perspiration much less. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful. (Pause.) The way man adapts himself. (Pause.) To changing conditions. (She transfers parasol to left hand.
Long pause.) Holding up wearies the arm. (Pause.) Not if one is going along. (Pause.) Only if one is at rest. (Pause.) That is a curious observation. (Pause.) I hope you heard that, Willie, I should be grieved to think you had not heard that. (She takes parasol in both hands. Long pause.) I am weary, holding it up, and I cannot put it down. (Pause.) I am worse off with it up than with it down, and I cannot put it down. (Pause.) Reason says, Put it down, Winnie, it is not helping you, put the thing down and get on with something else. (Pause.) I cannot. (Pause.) I cannot move.
(Pause.) No, something must happen, in the world, take place, some change, I cannot, if I am to move again.
(Pause.) Willie. (Mildly.) Help. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) Bid me put this thing down, Willie, I would obey you instantly, as I have always done, honoured and obeyed.† (Pause.) Please, Willie. (Mildly.) For pity's sake. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) You can't? (Pause.) Well I don't blame you, no, it would ill become me, who cannot move, to blame my Willie because he cannot speak. (Pause.) Fortunately I am in tongue again. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, my two lamps, when one goes out the other burns brighter. (Pause.) Oh yes, great mercies. (Maximum pause.
The parasol goes on fire. Smoke, flames if feasible. She sniffs, looks up, throws parasol to her right behind mound, cranes back to watch it burning. Pause.) Ah earth you old extin-guisher. (Back front.) I presume this has occurred before, though I cannot recall it. (Pause.) Can you, Willie? (Turns a little towards him.) Can you recall this having occurred before? (Pause. Cranes back to look at him.) Do you know what has occurred, Willie? (Pause.) Have you gone off on me again? (Pause.) I do not ask if you are alive to all that is going on, I merely ask if you have not gone off on me again. (Pause.) Your eyes appear to be closed, but that has no particular significance we know. (Pause.) Raise a finger, dear, will you please, if you are not quite senseless. (Pause.) Do that for me, Willie please, just the little finger, if you are still conscious. (Pause. Joyful.) Oh all five, you are a darling today, now I may continue with an easy mind.
(Back front.) Yes, what ever occurred that did not occur before and yet... I wonder, yes, I confess I wonder.
(Pause.) With the sun blazing so much fiercer down, and hourly fiercer, is it not natural? things should go on fire never known to do so, in this way I mean, spontaneous like. (Pause.) Shall I myself not melt perhaps in the end, or burn, oh I do not mean necessarily burst into flames, no, just little by little be charred to a black cinder, all this
—(ample gesture of arms)-visible flesh. (Pause.) On the other hand, did I ever know a temperate time? (Pause.) No. (Pause.) I speak of temperate times and torrid times, they are empty words. (Pause.) I speak of when I was not yet caught—in this way—and had my legs and had the use of my legs, and could seek out a shady place,† like you, when I was tired of the sun, or a sunny place when I was tired of the shade, like you, and they are all empty words.
(Pause.) It is no hotter today than yesterday, it will be no hotter tomorrow than today, how could it, and so on back into the far past, forward into the far future. (Pause.) And should one day the earth cover my breasts, then I shall never have seen my breasts, no one ever seen my breasts.
(Pause.) I hope you caught something of that, Willie, I should be sorryt to think you had caught nothing of all that, it is not every day I rise to such heights. (Pause.) Yes, something seems to have occurred, something has seemed to occur, and nothing has occurred, nothing at all, you are quite right, Willie. (Pause.) The sunshade will be there again tomorrow, beside me on this mound, † to help me through the day. (Pause. She takes up mirror.) I take up this little glass, I shiver it on a stone— (does so) —I throw it away-(does so far behind her).
-it will be in the bag again
tomorrow, without a scratch, to help me through the day.f (Pause.) No, one can do nothing. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, the way things... (voice breaks, head down) ... things ... so wonderful. (Long pause, head down. Finally turns, still bowed, to bag, brings out unidentifiable odds and ends, stuffs them back, fumbles deeper, brings out finally musical-box, winds it up, turns it on, listens for a moment holding it in both hands, huddled over it, turns back front, straightens up and listens to tune, holding box to breast with both hands. It plays the Waltz Duet "I love you so from The Merry Widow. Gradually happy expression.
She sways to the rhythm. Music stops. Pause. Brief burst of hoarse song without words-musical-box tune—from WILLIE.
Increase of happy expression. She lays down box.) Oh this will have been a happy day! (She claps hands.) Again, Willie, again! (Claps.) Encore, Willie, please! (Pause. Happy expression off.) No? You won't do that for me? (Pause.) Well it is very understandable, very understandable.† One cannot sing just to please someone, however much one loves them, no, song must come from the heart, that is what I always say, pour out from the inmost, like a thrush.
(Pause.) How often I have said, in evil hours, Sing now, Winnie, sing your song," there is nothing else for it, and did not. (Pause.) Could not. (Pause.) No, like the thrush, or the bird of dawning,? with no thought of benefit, to oneself or anyone else. (Pause.) And now? (Long pause. Low.) Strange feeling. (Pause. Do.) Strange feeling that someone is looking at me.70 T am clear, then dim, then gone, then dim again, then clear again, and so on, back and forth, in and out of someone's eye. (Pause. Do.) Strange? (Pause. Do.) No, here all is strange. (Pause. Normal voice,) Something says, Stop talking now, Winnie, for a minute, don't squander all your words for the day, stop talking and do something for a change, will you? (She raises hands and holds them open before her eyes. Apostrophic.) Do something!
(She closes hands.) What claws! (She turns to bag, rummages in it, brings out finally a nailfile, turns back front and begins to file nails. Files for a time in silence, then the following punctuated by filing.) There floats up-into my thoughts-a Mr. Showers—a Mr. and perhaps a Mrs. Shower—no-they are holding hands-his fiancée then more likely-or just some—loved one. (Looks closer at nails.) Very brittle today. (Resumes filing.) Shower-Shower-does the name mean anything—to you, Willie- evoke any reality, I mean
—for you, Willie-don't answer if you don't-feel up to it—you have done more-than your bit-already— Shower-Shower. (Inspects filed nails.) Bit more like it.
(Raises head, gazes front.) Keep yourself nice, Winnie, that's what I always say, come what may, keep yourself nice. (Pause. Resumes filing.) Yes-Shower-Shower— (stops filing, raises head, gazes front, pause)—or Cooker, perhaps I should say Cooker. (Turning a little towards WILLIE.) Cooker, Willie, does Cooker strike a chord?
(Pause. Turns a little further. Louder.) Cooker, Willie, does Cooker ring a bell, the name Cooker? (Pause. She cranes back to look at him. Pause.) Oh really! (Pause.) Have you no handkerchief, darling? (Pause.) Have you no delicacy?
(Pause,) Oh, Willie, you're not eating it!81 Spit it out, dear, spit it out! (Pause. Back front.) Ah well, I suppose it's only natural. (Break in voice) Human. (Pause. Do.) What is one to do? (Head down. Do.) All day long. (Pause. Do.) Day after day. (Pause. Head up. Smile. Calm.) The old style! (Smile off. Resumes nails.) No, done him. (Passes on to next.) Should have put on my glasses. (Pause.) Too late now. (Finishes left hand, inspects it.) Bit more human.
(Starts right hand. Following punctuated as before.) Well anyway-this man Shower-or Cooker—no matter-and the woman—hand in hand—in the other hands bags— kind of big brown grips-standing there gaping at me—and at last this man Shower—or Cooker—ends in 'er anyway— stake my life on thatt —What's she doing? he says—What's the idea? he says- stuck up to her diddies in the bleeding ground-coarse fellow-What does it mean? he says—
What's it meant to mean?-and so on—lot more stuff like that—usual drivel-Do you hear me? he says—I do, she says, God help me-What do you mean, he says, God help you? (Stops filing, raises head, gazes front.) And you, she says, what's the idea of you, she says, what are you meant to mean? Is it because you're still on your two flat feet, with your old ditty full of tinned muck and changes of underwear, dragging me up and down this fornicating wilderness, coarse creature, fit mate-(with sudden violence)
—let go of my hand and drop for God's sake, she says, drop! (Pause. Resumes filing.) Why doesn't he dig her out? he says-referring to you, my dear-What good is she to him like that?—What good is he to her like that? —and so on—usual tosh—Good! she says, have a heart for God's sake— Dig her out, he says, dig her out, no sense in her like that—Dig her out with what? she says-I'd dig her out with my bare hands, he says-must have been man and-wife. (Files in silence.) Next thing they're away— hand in hand—and the bags-dim-then gone—last human kind—to stray this way. (Finishes right hand, inspects it, lays down file, gazes front.) Strange thing, time like this, drift up into the mind. (Pause.) Strange? (Pause.) No, here all is strange. (Pause.) Thankful for it in any case.
(Voice breaks.) Most thankful. (Head down. Pause. Head up. Calm.) Bow and raise the head, bow and raise, always that. (Pause.) And now? (Long pause. Starts putting things back in bag, toothbrush last. This operation, interrupted by pauses as indicated, punctuates following.) It is perhaps a little soon®-to make ready-for the night stops tidying, head up, smile) — the old style!- (smile off, resumes tidying)
—and yet I do—make ready for the night-feeling it at hand-the bell for sleep— saying to myself-Winnie-it will not be long now, Winnie—until the bell for sleep.+ (Stops tidying, head up.) Sometimes I am wrong. (Smile.) But not often. (Smile off.) Sometimes all is over, for the day, all done, all said, all ready for the night, and the day not over, far from over, the night not ready, far, far from ready. (Smile.) But not often. (Smile off.) Yes, the bell for sleep,t when I feel it at hand, and so make ready for the night —(gesture)—in this way, sometimes I am wrong-(smile)
-but not often. (Smile off. Resumes tidying.) I used to think—I say I used to think-that all these things-put back into the bag—if too soon—put back too soon—could be taken out again—if necessary—if needed-and so on— indefinitely-back into the bag-back out of the bag-until the bell-went. (Stops tidying, head up, smile.) But no. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Resumes tidying.) I suppose this-might seem strange-this-what shall I say
—this what I have said—yes—(she takes up revolver) - strange—(she turns to put revolver in bag)—were it not— (about to put revolver in bag she arrests gesture and turns back front)—were it not—(she lays down revolver to her right, stops tidying, head up)-that all seems strange.
(Pause.) Most strange. (Pause.) Never any change. (Pause.) And more and more strange. (Pause. She bends to mound again, takes up last object, i.e. toothbrush,83 and turns to put it in bag while her attention is drawn to disturbance from WILLIE. 84 She cranes back and to her right to see. Pause.) Weary of your hole, dear? (Pause.) Well I can understand that. (Pause.) Don't forget your straw. (Pause.) Not the crawler you were, poor darling. (Pause.) No, not the crawler I gave my heart to. (Pause.) The hands and knees, love, try the hands and knees. (Pause.) The knees! The knees! (Pause.) What a curse, mobility! (She follows with eyes his progress towards her behind mound, i.e. towards place he occupied at beginning of act.) Another foot, Willie, and you're home. (Pause as she observes last foot.) Ah! (Turns
back front laboriously, rubs neck.) Crick in my neck
admiring you. (Rubs neck.) But it's worth it, well worth it.
(Turning slightly towards him.) Do you know what I dream sometimes? (Pause.) What I dream sometimes, Willie.
(Pause.) That you'll come round and live this side where I could see you. (Pause. Back front.) I'd be a different woman. (Pause.) Unrecognizable. (Turning slightly towards him.) Or just now and then, come round this side just every now and then and let me feast on you. 85 (Back front.) But you can't, I know. (Head down.) I know. (Pause. Head up.) Well anyway—(looks at toothbrush in her hand)-can't be long now—(looks at brush)—until the bell. (Top back of WILLIE's head appears above slope. WINNIE looks closer at brush.) Fully guaranteed... (head up) ... what's this it was? (WILLIE's hand appears with handkerchief, spreads it on skull, disappears.) Genuine pure ... fully guaranteed ...
(WILLIE's hand appears with boater, settles it on head, rakish angle, disappears) ... genuine pure ... ah! hog's setae.
(Pause.) What is a hog exactly? (Pause. Turns slightly towards WILLIE.) What exactly is a hog, Willie, do you know, I can't remember. (Pause. Turning a little further, pleading.) What is a hog, Willie, please!
(Pause.)
WILLIE. Castrated male swine. (Happy expression appears on
WINNIE's face.) Reared for slaughter.
(Happy expression increases. WILLIE opens newspaper, hands invisible. Tops of yellow sheets appear on either side of his head. WINNIE gazes before her with happy expression.)
WINNIE. Oh this is a happy day! This will have been another happy day! (Pause.) After all. (Pause.) So far.
(Pause. Happy expression off. WILLIE turns page. Pause. He turns another page.† Pause.)
WILLIE. Opening for smart youth.
(Pause. WINNIE takes off hat, turns to put it in bag, arrests gesture, turns back front. Smile.)
WINNIE. No. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Puts on hat again, gazes front, pause.) And now? (Pause.) Sing. (Pause.) Sing your song, Winnie. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) Then pray.
(Pause.) Pray your prayer, Winnie.
(Pause. WILLIE turns page. Pause.)
WILLIE. Wanted bright boy.
(Pause. WINNIE gazes before her. WILLIE turns page. Pause.
Newspaper disappears. Long pause.)
WINNIE. Pray your old prayer, Winnie.
(Long pause.)
CURTAIN
ACT TWO
Scene as before.
WINNIE embedded up to neck, hat on head, eyes closed. Her head, which she can no longer turn, nor bow, nor raise, faces front motionless throughout act. Movements of eyes as indicated.
Bag and parasol as before. Revolver conspicuous to her right on mound.
Long pause.
Bell rings loudly. She opens eyes at once. Bell stops. She gazes front. Long pause.
WINNIE. Hail, holy light.' (Long pause. She closes her eyes. Bell rings loudly. She opens eyes at once. Bell stops. She gazes front. Long smile. Smile off. Long pause.) Someone is looking at me still. (Pause.) Caring for me still. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful. (Pause.) Eyes on my eyes.
(Pause.) What is that unforgettable line?? (Pause. Eyes right.) Willie. (Pause. Louder.) Willie. (Pause. Eyes front.)
May one still speak of time? (Pause.) Say it is a long time now, Willie, since I saw you. (Pause.) Since I heard you.
(Pause.) May one? (Pause.) One does. (Smile.) The old style! (Smile off.) There is so little one can speak of.
(Pause.) One speaks of it all. (Pause.) All one can. (Pause.)
I used to think ... (pause) ... I say I used to think that I would learn to talk alone. (Pause.) By that I mean to myself, the wilderness. (Smile.) But no. (Smile broader.)
No no. (Smile off.) Ergo you are there.' (Pause.) Oh no doubt you are dead, like the others, no doubt you have died, or gone away and left me, like the others, it doesn't matter, you are there. (Pause. Eyes left.) The bag too is there, the same as ever, I can see it. (Pause. Eyes right.
Louder.) The bag is there, Willie, as good as ever, the one you gave me that day... to go to market." (Pause. Eyes front.) That day. (Pause.) What day? (Pause.) I used to pray. (Pause.) I say I used to pray. (Pause.) Yes, I must confess I did. (Smile.) Not now. (Smile broader.) No no.
(Smile off. Pause.) Then ... now ... what difficulties here, for the mind. (Pause.) To have been always what I am—and so changed from what I was. (Pause.) I am the one, I say the one, then the other. (Pause.) Now the one, then the other. (Pause.) There is so little one can say, one says it all. (Pause.) All one can. (Pause.) And no truth in it anywhere. (Pause.) My arms. (Pause.) My breasts. (Pause.) What arms? (Pause.) What breasts? (Pause.) Willie. (Pause.) What Willie? (Sudden vehement affirmation.) My Willie!
(Eyes right, calling.) Willie! (Pause. Louder.) Willie! (Pause. Eyes front.) Ah well, not to know, not to know for sure, great mercy, all I ask. (Pause.) Ah yes... then... now ... beechen green' … this… Charlie... kisses ... this ... all that... deep trouble for the mind. (Pause.) But it does not trouble mine. (Smile.) Not now. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Long pause. She closes eyes. Bell rings loudly. She opens eyes. Pause.) Eyes float up that seem to close in peace... to see ... in peace. (Pause.) Not mine. (Smile.) Not now. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Long pause.) Willie. (Pause.) Do you think the earth has lost its atmosphere, Willie? (Pause.) Do you, Willie?
(Pause.) You have no opinion? (Pause.) Well that is like you, you never had any opinion about anything. (Pause.) It's understandable. (Pause.) Most. (Pause.) The carthbal.
(Pause.) I sometimes wonder. (Pause.) Perhaps not quite all. (Pause.) There always remains something. (Pause.) Of everything. (Pause.) Some remains. (Pause.) If the mind were to go. (Pause.) It won't of course. (Pause.) Not quite.
(Pause.) Not mine. (Smile.) Not now. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Long pause.) It might be the eternal cold. (Pause.) Everlasting perishing cold. (Pause.) Just chance, I take it, happy chance. (Pause.) Oh yes, great mercies, great mercies. (Pause.) And now? (Long pause.) The face. (Pause.) The nose. (She squints down.) I can see it (squinting down) ... the tip… the nostrils.. breath of life… that curve you so admired… (points)... a hint of lip ... (pouts again)... if I pout them out… (sticks out tongue) ... the tongue of course… you so admired… if I stick it out ... (sticks it out again) ... the tip... (eyes up) ... suspicion of brow… eyebrow… imagination possibly ... (eyes left)... cheek… no… (eyes right)... no… (distends cheeks)... even if I puff them out… eyes left, distends cheeks again)... no… no
damask.(Eyes front.) That is all. (Pause.) The bag of course… (eyes left)... a little blurred perhaps… but the bag. Eyes front. Offhand.) The earth of course and sky. (Eyes right.) The sunshade you gave me... that day… pause)... that day… the lake… the reeds. (Eyes
front. Pause.) What day? (Pause.) What reeds? (Long pause. Eyes close. Bell rings loudly. Eyes open. Pause. Eyes right.) Brownie of course. (Pause.) You remember Brownie, Willie, I can see him. (Pause.) Brownie is there, Willie, beside me. (Pause. Loud.) Brownie is there, Willie. (Pause. Eyes front.) That is all. (Pause.) What would I do without them? (Pause.) What would I do without them, when words fail? (Pause.) Gaze before me, with compressed lips. (Long pause while she does so.) I cannot. (Pause,) Ah yes, great mercies, great mercies. (Long pause. Low.) Sometimes, I hear sounds. (Listening expression. Normal voice.) But not often. (Pause.) They are a boon, sounds are a boon, they help me... through the day. (Smile.) The old style!
(Smile off.) Yes, those are happy days, when there are sounds. (Pause.) When I hear sounds. (Pause.) I used to think... (pause). I say I used to think they were in my head. (Smile.) But no. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off.) That was just logic. (Pause.) Reason. (Pause.) I have not lost my reason. (Pause.) Not yet. (Pause.) Not all. (Pause.) Some remains. (Pause.) Sounds. (Pause.) Like little ... sunderings, little falls... apart. (Pause. Low.) It's things, Willie. (Pause. Normal voice.) In the bag, outside the bag.
(Pause.) Ah yes, things have their life, that is what I always say, things have a life. (Pause.) Take my looking-glass, it doesn't need me. (Pause.) The bell. (Pause.) It hurts like a knife. (Pause.) A gouge. (Pause.) One cannot ignore it. (Pause.) How often... (pause) ... I say how often I have said, Ignore it, Winnie, ignore the bell, pay no heed, just sleep and wake, sleep and wake, as you please, open and close the eyes, as you please, or in the way you find most helpful. (Pause.) Open and close the eyes, Winnie, open and close, always that. (Pause.) But no. (Smile.) Not now. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off. Pause.)
What now?(Pause.) What now, Willie? (Long pause.)
There is my story of course, when all else fails. (Pause.) A life. (Smile.) A long life. (Smile off.) Beginning in the womb, where life used to begin, Mildred has memories," she will have memories, of the womb, before she dies, the mother's womb. (Pause.) She is now four or five already and has recently been given a big waxen dolly. (Pause.) Fully clothed, complete outfit. (Pause.) Shoes, socks, undies, complete set, frilly frock, gloves. (Pause) White mesh. (Pause.) A little white straw hat with a chin elastic.
(Pause.) Pearly necklace. 1ª (Pause.) A little picture-book with legends in real print to go under her arm when she takes her walk. (Pause.) China blue eyest that open and shut. (Pause. Narrative.) The sun was not well up when Milly rose, descended the steep ... (pause) ... slipped on her nightgown, descended all alone the steep wooden stairs, backwards on all fours, though she had been forbidden to do so, entered the ... (pause) ... tiptoed down the silent passage, entered the nursery and began to undress Dolly.
(Pause.) Crept under the table and began to undress Dolly.
(Pause.) Scolding her ... the while. (Pause.) Suddenly a mouse—(Long pause.) Gently, Winnie. (Long pause. Calling.) Willie! (Pause. Louder.) Willie! (Pause. Mild reproach.) I sometimes find your attitude a little strange, Willie, all this time, it is not like you to be wantonly cruel. (Pause.)
Strange? (Pause.) No. (Smile.) Not here. (Smile broader.)
Not now. (Smile off.) And yet ... (Suddenly anxious.) I do hope nothing is amiss. (Eyes right, loud.) Is all well, dear?
(Pause. Eyes front. To herself.) God grant he did not go in head foremost! (Eyes right, loud.) You're not stuck, Willie?
(Pause. Do.) You're not jammed, Willie? (Eyes front, distressed.) Perhaps he is crying out for help all this time and I do not hear him! (Pause.) I do of course hear cries.
(Pause.) But they are in my head surely. (Pause.) Is it possible that... (Pause. With finality.) No no, my head was always full of cries. (Pause.) Faint confused cries.
(Pause.) They come. (Pause.) Then go. (Pause.) As on a wind. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful. (Pause.) They cease. (Pause.) Ah yes, great mercies, great mercies.
(Pause.) The day is now well advanced. (Smile. Smile off.) And yet it is perhaps a little soon for my song. (Pause.) To sing soon is fatal, I always find. (Pause.) On the other hand it is possible ot leave it too late. (Pause). The bell goes for sleep and one has not sung. (Pause.) The whole day has flown (smile, smile off) — flown by, quite by, and no song of any class, kind or description. (Pause.) There is a problem here. (Pause.) One cannot sing ... just like that, no. (Pause.) It bubbles up, for some unknown reason, the time is ill chosen, one chokes it back. (Pause.) One says, Now is the time, it is now or never, and one cannot. (Pause.) Simply cannot sing. (Pause.) Not a note.
(Pause.) Another thing, Willie, while we are on this subject.
(Pause.) The sadness after song. (Pause.) Have you run across that, Willie? (Pause.) In the course of your experience. (Pause.) No? (Pause.) Sadness after intimate sexual intercourse one is familiar with of course. (Pause.) You would concur with Aristotle there, Willie, 13 I fancy.
(Pause.) Yes, that one knows and is prepared to face.
(Pause.) But after song ... (Pause.) It does not last of course. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful. (Pause.)
It wears away. (Pause.) What are those exquisite lines?
(Pause.) Go forget melt why should something o'er that something shadow fling ... go forget me
.. why should
sorrow... brightly smile ... go forget me ... never hear me... sweetly smile... brightly sing ... (Pause. With a sigh.) One loses one's classics. (Pause.) Oh not all. (Pause.) A part. (Pause.) A part remains. (Pause.) That is what I find so wonderful, a part remains, of one's classics, to help one through the day. (Pause.) Oh yes, many mercies, many mercies. (Pause.) And now? (Pause.) And now, Willie?
(Long pause.) I call to the eye of the mind… Mr. Shower-or Cooker. (She closes her eyes. Bell rings loudly. She opens her eyes. Pause.) Hand in hand, in the other hands bags. (Pause.) Getting on ... in life. (Pause.) No longer young, not yet old. (Pause.) Standing there gaping at me. (Pause.) Can't have been a bad bosom, he says, in its day.
(Pause.) Seen worse shoulders, he says, in my time. (Pause.)
Does she feel her legs? he says. (Pause.) Is there any life in her legs? he says. (Pause.) Has she anything on under-neath? he says. (Pause.) Ask her, he says, I'm shy. (Pause.)
Ask her what? she says. (Pause.) Is there any life in her legs. (Pause.) Has she anything on underneath. (Pause.)
Ask her yourself, she says. (Pause. With sudden violence.) Let go of me for Christ sake and drop! (Pause. Do.) Drop dead! (Smile.) But no. (Smile broader.) No no. (Smile off.)
I watch them recede. (Pause.) Hand in hand—and the bags. (Pause.) Dim. (Pause.) Then gone. (Pause.) Last human kind—to stray this way. (Pause.) Up to date.
(Pause.) And now? (Pause. Low.) Help. (Pause. Do.) Help, Willie. (Pause. Do.) No? (Long pause. Narrative.) Suddenly a mouse ... (Pause.) Suddenly a mouse ran up her little thigh and Mildred, dropping Dolly in her fright, began to scream-(WINNIE gives a sudden piercing scream)—and screamed16 and screamed-
-(WINNIE screams twice) —
screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed till all came running, in their night attire, papa, mamma, Bibby and... old Annie, to see what was the matter ... (pause)
... what on earth could possibly be the matter. (Pause.)
Too late. (Pause.) Too late. (Long pause. Just audible.) Willie. (Pause. Normal voice.) Ah well, not long now, Winnie, can't be long now, until the bell for sleep. (Pause.) Then you may close your eyes, then you must close your eyes—and keep them closed. (Pause.) Why say that again?
(Pause.) I used to think ... (pause) ... I say I used to think there was no difference between one fraction of a second and the next. (Pause.) I used to say ... (pause) ...
I say I used to say, Winnie, you are changeless, there is never any difference between one fraction of a second and the next. (Pause.) Why bring that up again? (Pause.) There is so little one can bring up, one brings up all. (Pause.) All one can. (Pause.) My neck is hurting me. (Pause. With sudden violence.) My neck is hurting me! (Pause.) Ah that's better. (With mild irritation.) Everything within reason.
(Long pause.) I can do no more. (Pause.) Say no more.
(Pause.) But I must say more. (Pause.) Problem here.
(Pause.) No, something must move,*
17 in the world, I can't
any more. (Pause.) A zephyr. (Pause.) A breath. (Pause.) What are those immortal lines? (Pause.) It might be the eternal dark. (Pause.) Black night without end. (Pause.) Just chance, I take it, happy chance. (Pause.) Oh yes, abounding mercies. (Long pause.) And now? (Pause.) And now, Willie? (Long pause.) That day. (Pause.) The pink fizz. (Pause.) The flute glasses. (Pause.) The last guest gone. (Pause.) The last bumpert with the bodies nearly touching. (Pause.) The look. (Long pause.) What day?
(Long pause.) What look? (Long pause.) I hear cries. (Pause.)
Sing. (Pause.) Sing your old song, Winnie.
(Long pause. Suddenly alert expression. Eyes switch right.
WILLIE's head appears18 to her right round corner of mound.
He is on all fours, dressed to kill-top hat, morning coat, striped trousers, etc., white gloves in hand. Very long bushy white Battle of Britain moustache. He halts, gazes front, smooths moustache. He emerges completely from behind mound, turns to his left, halts, looks up at WINNIE. He advances on all fours towards centre, halts, turns head front, gazes front, strokes moustache, straightens tie, adjusts hat, advances a little further, halts, takes off hat and looks up at WINNIB. He is now not far from centre and within her field of vision.
Unable to sustain effort of looking up he sinks head to ground.)
WINNIE. (mondaine). Well this is an unexpected pleasure! (Pause.)
Reminds me of the day you came whining for my hand. (Pause.) I worship you, Winnie, be mine. (He looks up.)
Life a mockery without Win. (She goes off into a giggle.)
What a get up, you do look a sight! (Giggles.) Where are the flowers? (Pause.) That smile today. 1% (WILLIE sinks head.) What's that on your neck, an anthrax? (Pause.) Want to watch that, Willie, before it gets a hold on you. (Pause.) Where were you all this time? (Pause.) What were you doing all this time? (Pause.) Changing? (Pause.) Did you not hear me screaming for you? (Pause.) Did you get stuck in your hole? (Pause. He looks up.) That's right, Willie, look at me. (Pause.) Feast your old eyes, Willie. (Pause.) Does anything remain? (Pause.) Any remains? (Pause.) No?
(Pause.) I haven't been able to look after it, you know.
(He sinks his head.) You are still recognizable, in a way.
(Pause.) Are you thinking of coming to live this side now ... for a bit maybe? (Pause.) No? (Pause.) Just a brief call? (Pause.) Have you gone deaf, Willie? (Pause.) Dumb?
(Pause.) Oh I know you were never one to talk, I worship you Winnie be mine and then nothing from that day forth only titbits from Reynolds' News. (Eyes front. Pause.) Ah well, what matter, that's what I always say, it will have been a happy day, after all, another happy day. (Pause.) Not long now, Winnie. (Pause.) I hear cries. (Pause.) Do you ever hear cries, Willie? (Pause.) No? (Eyes back on WILLIE.)
Willie. (Pause.) Look at me again, Willie. (Pause.) Once more, Willie. (He looks up. Happily.) Ah! (Pause. Shocked.)
What ails you, Willie, I never saw such an expression!
(Pause.) Put on your hat, dear, it's the sun, don't stand on ceremony, I won't mind. (He drops hat and gloves and starts to crawl up mound towards her. Gleeful.) Oh I say, this is terrific! (He halts, clinging to mound with one hand, reaching up with the other.) Come on, dear, put a bit of jizz into it, I'll cheer you on. (Pause.) Is it me you're after, Willie ... or is it something else? (Pause.) Do you want to touch my face... again? (Pause.) Is it a kiss you're after, Willie... or is it something else? (Pause.) There was a time when I could have given you a hand. (Pause.) And then a time before that again when I did give you a hand, (Pause.) You were always in dire need of a hand, Wille.
(He slithers back to foot of mound and lies with face to ground.) Brrum! (Pause. He rises to hands and knees, raises his face towards her.) Have another go, Willie, I’ll cheer you on. (Pause.) Don't look at me like that! (Pause.
Vehement.) Don't look at me like that! (Pause. Low.) Have you gone off your head, Willie? (Pause. Do.) Out of your poor old wits, Willie?
(Pause.)
(Pause. WINNIE's eyes front. Happy expression appears, grows.)
WILLIE. (Just audible). Win. 
WINNIE. Win! (Pause.) Oh this is a happy day, this will have been another happy day! (Pause.) After all. (Pause.) So far.
(Pause. She hums tentatively beginning of song, then sings softly, musical-box tune.)
Though I say not 
What I may not 
Let you hear, 
Yet the swaying 
Dance is saying, 
Love me dear!
Every touch of fingers
Tells me what I know, 
Says for you, It's true, it's true, 
You love me so!


(Pause.  Happy expression off. She closes her eyes. Bell rings loudly. She opens her eyes. She smiles, gazing front. She turns her eyes, smiling, to WILLIE, still on his hands and knees looking up at her. Smile off. They look at each other. Long pause.)
CURTAIN


Estragon, sitting on a low mound, is trying to take off his boot. He pulls at it with both hands, panting. He gives up, exhausted, rests, tries again.
As before.
Enter Vladimir.
giving up again). Nothing to be done. (advancing with short, stiff strides, legs wide apart). I'm beginning to come round to that opinion. All my life I've tried to put it from me, saying, Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't yet tried everything. And I resumed the struggle. (He broods, musing on the struggle. Turning to Estragon.) So there you are again.
Am IP
I'm glad to see you back. I thought you were gone for ever.
Me too..
Together again at last! We'll have to celebrate this. But how? (He reflects.) Get up till I embrace you.
(irritably). Not now, not now.
(hurt, coldly). May one enquire where His Highness spent the night?
In a ditch.
(admiringly). A ditch! Where? without gesture). Over there.
And they didn't beat you?
Beat me? Certainly they beat me.
The same lot as usual?
The same? I don't know.
When I think of it ... all these years... but for me... where would you be...? (Decisively.) You'd be nothing more than a little heap of bones at the present minute, no doubt about it.
And what of it?
VLADIMIR. (gloomily). It's too much for one man. (Pause.
Cheerfully.) On the other hand what's the good of losing heart now, that's what I say. We should have thought of it a million years ago, in the nineties.
ESTRAGON.
Ah stop blathering and help me off with this bloody thing.
VLADIMIR.
Hand in hand from the top of the Eiffel Tower, among the first. We were presentable in those days. Now it's too late. They wouldn't even let us up. (Estragon tears at his boot.) What are you doing?
ESTRAGON.
Taking off my boot. Did that never happen to you?
VLADIMIR.
Boots must be taken off every day, I'm tired telling you that. Why don't you listen to me?
ESTRAGON.
(feebly). Help me! FA: co
VLADIMIR.
It hurts?
ESTRAGON. Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!
VLADIMIR.
(angrily). No one ever suffers but you. I don't count. I'd like to hear what you'd say if you had what I have.
ESTRAGON.
It hurts?
VLADIMIR.
Hurts! He wants to know if it hurts!
ESTRAGON. (pointing). You might button it all the same.
VLADIMIR.
(stooping). True. (He buttons his fly.) Never neglect the little things of life.
ESTRAGON.
What do you expect, you always wait till the las moment.
VLADIMIR.
(musingly). The last moment.,. (He meditates, Hope deferred maketh the something sick, who said that?
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Why don't you help me?
Sometimes I feel it coming all the same. Then I all queer. (He takes off his hat, peers inside it, feels about inside it, shakes it, puts it on again.) How shall I say? Relieved and at the same time
(he searches for the word).. appalled. (With emphasis.) AP-PALLED. (He takes of his hat again, peers inside it.) Funny. (He knocks on the crown as though to dislodge a foreign body, peers into it again, puts it on again.) Nothing to be done.
(Estragon with a supreme effort succeeds in pulling off his boot. He looks inside it, feels about inside it, turns it upside down, shakes it, looks on the ground to see if anything has fallen out, finds nothing, feels inside it again, staring sightlessly before him.) Well?
Nothing.
Show.
There's nothing to show.
Try and put it on again.
N.
(examining his foot). I'll air it for a bit.
R.
There's man all over for you, blaming on his boots the faults of his feet. (He takes off his hat again, peers inside it, feels about inside it, knocks on the crown, blows into it, puts it on again.) This is getting alarming. (Silence. Vladimir deep in thought, Estragon pulling at his toes.) One of the thieves was saved. (Pause.) It's a reasonable percentage. (Pause.) Gogo.
N. What?
R. Suppose we repented.
N. Repented what?
R. Oh... (He reflects.) We wouldn't have to go into the details.
N.
Our being born?
Vladimir breaks into a hearty laugh which he immediately stifles, his hand pressed to his pubis, his face contorted.
R.
One daren't even laugh any more.
N. Dreadful privation.
R. Merely smile. He smiles suddenly from ear to ear, keeps smiling, ceases as suddenly.) It's not the same thing. Nothing to be done. (Pause.) Gogo.
(irritably). What is it?
VLADIMIR. Did you ever read the Bible?
ESTRAGON. The Bible... (He reflects.) I must have taken a
look at it.
VLADIMIR. Do you remember the Gospels?
ESTRAGON. I remember the maps of the Holy Land. Colours.
they were. Very pretty. The Dead Sea was pale blue. The very look of it made me thirsty. That where we'll go, I used to say, that's where we'll go for our honeymoon. We'll swim. We'll be hay
VLADIMIR. You should have been a poet.
ESTRAGON. I was. (Gesture towards his rags.) Isn't that
obvious.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. Where was I. How's your foot?
ESTRAGON. Swelling visibly.
VLADIMIR. Ah yes, the two thieves. Do you remember the
story?
ESTRAGON. No.
VLADIMIR. Shall I tell it to you?
ESTRAGON. No.
VLADIMIR. It'll pass the time. (Pause.) Two thieves,
Crucified at the same time as our Saviour. One-
ESTRAGON. Our what?
VLADIMIR.
Our Saviour. Two thieves. One is supposed to have been saved and the other... (he searches the contrary of saved) ... damned.
ESTRAGON.
Saved from what?
VLADIMIR.
Hell.
ESTRAGON. I'm going.
He does not move.
VLADIMIR.
And yet... (pause) ... how is it-this it not boring you I hope—how is it that of the four Evangelists only one speaks of a thief being sa The four of them were there or thereabouts-only one speaks of a thief being saved. (Pause Come on, Gogo, return the ball, can't you, once a way? (with exaggerated enthusiasm). I find this really most extraordinarily interesting
One out of four. Of the other three two don't mention any thieves at all and the third says that both of them abused him.
Who? What?
What's all this about? Abused who?
The Saviour.
Why?
Because he wouldn't save them.
From hell
Imbecile! From death.
I thought you said hell.
From death, from death.
Well what of it?
Then the two of them must have been damned.
And why not?
But one of the four says that one of the two was saved
Well They don't agree, and that's all there is to it.
But all four were there. And only one speaks of a thief being saved. Why believe him rather than the others?
Who believes him?
Everybody. It's the only version they know.
People are bloody ignorant apes.
He rises painfully, goes limping to extreme left, halts, gazes into distance off with his hand screening his eyes, turns, goes to extreme right, gazes into distance. Vladimir watches him, then goes and picks up the boot, peers into it, drops it hastily.
Pah!
He spits. Estragon moves to centre, halts with his back to auditorium.
Charming spot. (He turns, advances to front, halts facing auditorium.) Inspiring prospects. (He tig to Vladimir.) Let's go.
VLADIMIR. We can't.
ESTRAGON. Why not?
VLADIMIR. Were waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON. (despairingly). Ah! (Pause.) You're sure it was VLADIMIR. What?
ESTRAGON. That we were to wait.
VLADIMIR. He said by the tree. (They look at the tree.) D
you see any others?
ESTRAGON. What is it?
иво
VLADIMIR. I don't know. A willow.
ESTRAGON. Where are the leaves?
VLADIMIR. It must be dead
ESTRAGON. No more weeping
VLADIMIR. Or perhaps it's not the season.
ESTRAGON. Looks to me more like a bush.
VLADIMIR.
A shrub.
ESTRAGON.
A bush.
VLADIMIR. A—. What are you insinuating? That we've come to the wrong place?
ESTRAGON. He should be here.
VLADIMIR. He didn't say for sure he'd come.
ESTRAGON. And if he doesn't come?
VLADIMIR.
We'll come back tomorrow.
ESTRAGON. And then the day after tomorrow.
VLADIMIR. Possibly.
ESTRAGON. And so on.
VLADIMIR. The point is—
ESTRAGON. Until he comes.
VLADIMIR. You're merciless.
ESTRAGON. We came here yesterday.
VLADIMIR. Ah no, there you're mistaken.
ESTRAGON. What did we do yesterday?
VLADIMIR.
What did we do yesterday?
ESTRAGON. Yes.
VLADIMIR.
Why ... (Angrily). Nothing is certain when you about.
ESTRAGON. In my opinion we were here. 
STRAGON. In my opinion we were here.
LADIMIR.
(looking round). You recognize the place?
STRAGON. I didn't say that.
LADIMIR.
Well?
STRAGON.
That makes no difference.
LADIMIR.
All the same... that tree... (turning towards the auditorium) ... that bog
STRAGON.
LADIMIR：
STRAGON.
LADIMIR.
STRAGON.
7LADIMIR.
You're sure it was this evening?
What?
That we were to wait.
He said Saturday. (Pause.) I think.
You think.
I must have made a note of it.
He fumbles in his pockets, bursting with miscellaneous rubbish.
ISTRAGON.
(very insidious). But what Saturday? And is it Saturday? Is it not rather Sunday? (Pause.) Or Monday? (Pause.) Or Friday?
7LADIMIR.
(looking wildly about him, as though the date was inscribed in the landscape). It's not possible!
ASTRAGON. Or Thursday?
/LADIMIR. What'll we do?
STRAGON. If he came yesterday and we weren't here you may be sure he won't come again today.
7LADIMIR.
But you say we were here yesterday.
STRAGON.
I may be mistaken. (Pause.) Let's stop talking for a minute, do you mind?
LADIMIR.
(feebly). All right. (Estragon sits down on the mound. Vladimir paces agitatedly to and fro, halting from time to time to gaze into distance off.
Estragon falls asleep. Vladimir halts before Estragon.) Gogo! ... Gogol... GoGo!
Estragon wakes with a start. 
ISTRAGON.
(restored to the horror of his situation). I was ? asleep! (Despairingly.) Why will you never let me sleep?
7LADIMIR.
I felt lonely.
VOLSTRAGON. I had a dream.
VLADIMIR. Don't tell me!
ESTRAGON. I dreamt that—
VLADIMIR.
DON'T TELL ME!
ESTRAGON.
(gesture towards the universe). This one is enc for you? (Silence.) It's not nice of you, Didi. am I to tell my private nightmares to if I can't them to you?
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Let them remain private. You know I can't bear (coldly). There are times when I wonder if it wouldn't be better for us to part.
VLADIMIR. You wouldn't go far.
ESTRAGON. That would be too bad, really too bad. (Pause
Wouldn't it, Didi, be really too bad? (Pause.) When you think of the beauty of the way. (Pa And the goodness of the wayfarers. (Pause.
Wheedling.) Wouldn't it, Didi?
VLADIMIR.
Calm yourself.
чувственно
ESTRAGON. (voluptuously). Calm... calm ... The Englis
say cawm. (Pause.) You know the story of the Englishman in the brothelP
VLADIMIR.
Yes.
ESTRAGON. Tell it to me.
VLADIMIR. Ah stop it!
ESTRAGON. An Englishman having drunk a little more thick
usual goes to a brothel. The bawd asks him fiT wants a fair one, a dark one, or a red-haired on.
Go on.
VLADIMIR. STOP IT!
Exit Vladimir hurriedly. Estragon gets up and follows him as far as the limit of the stage.
Gestures of Estragon like those of a spectator encouraging a pugilist. Enter Vladimir. He br past Estragon, crosses the stage with bowed head. Estragon takes a step towards him, halt.
ESTRAGON.
(gently). You wanted to speak to me? (Silence.
Estragon takes a step forward.) You had something to say to me? (Silence. Another step forward.) Didi...
ADIMIR.
TRAGON.
(without turning). I've nothing to say to you. (step forward). You're angry? (Silence. Step forward.) Forgive me. (Silence. Step forward.
Estragon lays his hand on Vladimir's shoulder.)
Come, Didi. (Silence.) Give me your hand.
(Vladimir half turns.) Embrace mel (Vladimir stiffens.) Don't be stubborn! (Vladimir softens.
They embrace. Estragon recoils.) You stink of garlic!
LADIMIR.
It's for the kidneys. (Silence. Estragon looks лочка attentively at the tree. What do we do now?
STRAGON.
Wait.
LADIMIR. Yes, but while waiting.
STRAGON. What about hanging ourselves?
LADIMIR. Hmm. It'd give us an erection.
STRAGON. (highly excited). An erection!
LADIMIR. With all that follows. Where it falls mandrakes
grow. That's why they shriek when you pull them up. Did you not know that?
STRAGON. Let's hang ourselves immediately!
LADIMIR. From a bough? (They go towards the tree.) I
wouldn't trust it.
STRAGON.
We can always try.
LADIMIR. Go ahead.
STRAGON. After you.
LADIMIR. No no, you first.
STRAGON. Why me?
LADIMIR. You're lighter than I am.
STRAGON. Just so!
LADIMIR. I don't understand.
STRAGON. Use your intelligence, can't you?
Vladimir uses his intelligence.
LADIMIR. (finally). I remain in the dark.
STRAGON. This is how it is. (He reflects.) The bough... the bough... (Angrily). Use your head, can't you?
LADIMIR.
You're my only hope.
STRAGON. (with effort). Gogo light-bough not break—
Gogo dead. Didi heavy-bough break—Didi alone. Whereas
VLADIMIR.
I hadn't thought of that.
ESTRAGON.
If it hangs you it'll hang anything.
VLADIMIR.
But am I heavier than you?
ESTRAGON.
So you tell me. I don't know. There's an even chance. Or nearly.
VLADIMIR.
Well? What do we do?
ESTRAGON.
Don't let's do anything. It's safer.
VLADIMIR.
Let's wait and see what he says.
ESTRAGON. Who?
VLADIMIR. Godot.
ESTRAGON. Good idea.
VLADIMIR. Let's wait till we know exactly how we stand
ESTRAGON. On the other hand it might be better to strike te
iron before it freezes.
VLADIMIR. I'm curious to hear what he has to offer. Then v
take it or leave it.
ESTRAGON. What exactly did we ask him for?
VLADIMIR. Were you not there?
ESTRAGON. I can't have been listening.
VLADIMIR. Oh... nothing very definite.
ESTRACON. A kind of prayer.
VLADIMIR. Precisely.
ESTRAGON. A vague supplication.
VLADIMIR. Exactly.
ESTRAGON. And what did he reply?
VLADIMIR. That he'd see.
ESTRAGON. That he couldn't promise anything.
VLADIMIR. That he'd have to think it over.
ESTRAGON. In the quiet of his home.
VLADIMIR. Consult his family.
ESTRAGON. His friends.
VLADIMIR. His agents.
ESTRAGON. His correspondents.
VLADIMIR. His books.
ESTRAGON. His bank account.
VLADIMIR. Before taking a decision.
ESTRAGON. It's the normal thing.
VLADIMIR.
Is it not?
ESTRAGON.
I think it is.
VLADIMIR.
I think so too.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
(anxious). And we?
I beg your pardon?
I said, And we?
I don't understand.
Where do we come in?
Come in?
Take your time.
Come in? On our hands and knees.
As bad as that?
Your Worship wishes to assert his prerogatives?
We've no rights any more?
Laugh of Vladimir, stifled as before, less the smile.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
You'd make me laugh, if it wasn't prohibited.
We've lost our rights?
(distinctly). We got rid of them.
Store Therenti motionless, arms dangling, heads sunk, sagging at the knees. (feebly). We're not tied? (Pause.) We're not— Listen!
They listen, grotesquely rigid.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
I hear nothing.
Hssst! (They listen. Estragon loses his balance, almost falls. He clutches the arm of Vladimir, who
мататья,
totters. They listen, huddled together.) Nor I.
Kouteli
Sighs of relief. They relax and separate.
ESTRAGON.
You gave me a fright.
VLADIMIR.
I thought it was he.
ESTRAGON.
Who?
VLADIMIR.
Godot.
ESTRACON. Pah! The wind in the reeds.
VLADIMIR. I could have sworn I heard shouts.
absura
ESTRAGON. And why would he shout?
VLADIMIR. At his horse.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
(violently). I'm hungry.
Do you want a carrot?
Is that all there is?
I might have some turnips.
Give me a carrot. (Vladimir rummages in his
S
pockets, takes out a turnip and gives it to Estri
VLADIMIR.
who takes a bite out of it. Angrily.) It's a turnip Oh pardon! I could have sworn it was a carrot rummages again in his pockets, finds nothing turnips.) All that's turnips. (He rummages.) Yi must have eaten the last. (He rummages.) Was have it. (He brings out a carrot and gives it to Estragon.) There, dear fellow. (Estragon wipes carrot on his sleeve and begins to eat it.) Give the turnip. (Estragon gives back the turnip wi
S
Vladimir puts in his pocket.) Make it last, then the end of them.
S
ESTRAGON. (chewing). I asked you a question.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON. Did you reply?
VLADIMIR. How's the carrot.
ESTRAGON. It's a carrot.
VLADIMIR. So much the better, so much the better. (Panse
What was it you wanted to know?
ESTRAGON.
I've forgotten. (Chews.) That's what annoys m (He looks at the carrot appreciatively, dangles between finger and thumb.) I'll never forget this carrot. (He sucks the end of it meditatively.) A yes, now I remember.
VLADIMIR.
Well?
/ESTRAGON. (his mouth full, vacuously). We're not tied?
VLADIMIR. I don't hear a word you're saying.
ESTRAGON. (chews, swallows). I'm asking you if we're tied
VLADIMIR.
Tied?
ESTRAGON. Ti-ed.
VLADIMIR. How do you mean tied?
ESTRAGON. Down.
LADIMIR. But to whom. By whomP STRAGON.
To your man.
ILADIMIR：
To Godot Tied to Godot? What an ideal No question of it. (Pause.) For the moment.
STRAGON.
His name is Godot?
'LADIMIR：
I think so.
STRAGON. Fancy that. (He raises what remains of the carrot by the stub of leaf, twirls it before his eyes.)
Funny, the more you eat the worse it gets.
/LADIMIR.
With me it's just the opposite.
ISTRAGON.
In other words?
VLADIMIR.
I get used to the muck as I go along.
STRAGON.
after prolonged reflection). Is that the opposite?
VLADIMIR.
Question of temperament.
ISTRAGON.
Of character.
VLADIMIR.
Nothing you can do about it.
ESTRAGON.
No use struggling.
VLADIMIR.
One is what one is.
ESTRAGON.
No use wriggling.
VLADIMIR.
The essential doesn't change.
ESTRAGON.
Nothing to be done, (He proffers the remains of the carrot to Vladimir.) Like to finish it?
A terrible cry, close at hand. Estragon drops the carrot. They remain motionless, then together make a sudden rush towards the wings. Estragon stops half-way, runs back, picks up the carrot, stuffs it in his pocket, runs towards Vladimir who is waiting for him, stops again, runs back, picks up his boot, runs to rejoin Vladimir. Huddled together, shoulders hunched, cringing away from the menace, they wait.
Enter Pozzo and Lucky. Pozzo drives Lucky by means of a rope passed round his neck, so that Lucky is the first to appear, followed by the rope which is long enough to allow him to reach the middle of the stage before Pozzo appears. Lucky carries a heavy bag, a folding stool, a picnic basket and a greatcoat. Pozzo a whip.
POZZO. (of, On! (Crack of whip. Pozzo appears. Thei cross the stage. Lucky passes before Vladimir Estragon and exit. Pozzo at the sight of Vladin and Estragon stops short. The rope tautens. Pf jerks it violently.) Back!
Noise of Lucky falling with all his baggage.
Vladimir and Estragon turn towards him, half wishing half fearing to go to his assistanc Vladimir takes a step towards Lucky, Estrago holds him back by the sleeve.
VLADIMIR. Let me go!
ESTRAGON. Stay where you are!
POZZO. Be careful! He's wicked. (Vladimir and Estrag turn towards Pozzo.) With strangers.
ESTRAGON.
(undertone). Is that him?
VLADIMIR.
Who?
ESTRAGON. (trying to remember the name). Er ...
VLADIMIR. Godot?
ESTRAGON. Yes.
POZZO. I present myself: Pozzo.
VLADIMIR.
(to Estragon). Not at all!
ESTRAGON.
He said Godot.
VLADIMIR.
Not at all!
ESTRAGON.
POZZO.
(timidly to Pozzo). You're not Mr. Godot, sir? (terrifying voice). I am Pozzo! (Silence.) Pozzo-(Silence.) Does that name mean nothing to you?
(Silence.) I say does that name mean nothing to you?
Vladimir and Estragon look at each other
ESTRAGON.
petningy Me Se. Bore.
Bozzo
VLADIMIR.
(ditto). Pozzo... Pozzo ...
POZZO.
PPPOZZZO!
ESTRAGON. Ah! Pozzo... let me see... Pozzo...
VLADIMIR.
It is Pozzo or Bozzo?
ESTRAGON.
Pozzo... no... I'm afraid I... no ... I don't seem to ...
Pozzo advances threateningly.
GLADIMIR.
(conciliating). I once knew a family called Gozzo.
The mother had the clap.
STRAGON. (hastily). We're not from these parts, sir.
POZZO. (halting). You are human beings none the less.\(He puts on his glasses.) As far as one can see. (He takes off his glasses.) Of the same species as myself. (He bursts into an enormous laugh.) Of the same species as Pozzol Made in God's image! V
LADIMIR. Well you see-POZZO. (peremptory). Who is Godot?
STRAGON. Godot?
POZZO. You took me for Godot.
STRAGON. Oh no, sir, not for an instant, sir.
POZZO. Who is he?
LADIMIR. Oh, he's a ... he's a kind of acquaintance.
STRAGON. Nothing of the kind, we hardly know him.
LADIMIR. True... we don't know him very well... but all
the same ...
STRAGON. Personally I wouldn't even know him if I saw him.
POZZO. You took me for him.
STRAGON. (recoiling before Pozzo). That's to say ... you
understand... the dusk... the strain... waiting ... I confess... I imagined... for a second...
POZZO. Waiting? So you were waiting for him?
LADIMIR. Well you see—
POZZO. Here? On my land?
LADIMIR. We didn't intend any harm.
STRAGON. We meant well.
POZZO. The road is free to all.
LADIMIR. That's how we looked at it.
POZZO. It's a disgrace. But there you are.
STRAGON. Nothing we can do about it.
POZZO. (with magnanimous gesture). Let's say no more about it. (He jerks the rope.) Up pig! (Pause.) Every time he drops he falls asleep. (Jerks the rope.) Up hog! (Noise of Lucky getting up and picking up his baggage. Pozzo jerks the rope.) Back! (Enter Lucky backwards.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! Lucky turns. To Vladimir and Estragon, affably.) Gentlemen, I am happy to hang met you. (Before their incredulous expression.)
Yes, yes, sincerely happy. (He jerks the rope.)
Closer! (Lucky advances.) Stop! (Lucky stops. Yo the road seems long when one journeys all alone for ... (he consults his watch ... yes ... (he calculates) ... yes, six hours, that's right, six hours on end, and never a soul in sight. (To Lucky.) Coat! (Lucky puts down the bag, advances, gives the coat, goes back to his place, takes up the bag) Hold that! (Pozzo holds out the whip. Lucky advances,and, both his hands being occupied, takes the whip in his mouth, then goes back to his place. Pozzo begins to put on his coat, stops.) Coat! (Lucky puts down bag, basket and stool, advances, helps Pozzo on with his coat, goes back to his place and takes up bag, basket and stool.)
Touch of autumn in the air this evening. (Pozz0 finishes buttoning his coat, stoops, inspects himself, straightens up.) Whip! (Lucky advances, stoops, Pozzo snatches the whip from his mouth, Lucky goes back to his place.) Yes, gentlemen, I cannot go for long without the society of my likes (he puts on his glasses and looks at the two likes) even when the likeness is an imperfect one. (He takes off his glasses.) Stool! (Lucky puts down bag and basket, advances, opens stool, puts it down, goes back to his place, takes up bag and basket.)
Closer! (Lucky puts down bag and basket, advances, moves stool, goes back to his place, takes up bag and basket. Pozzo sits down, places the butt of his whip against Lucky's chest and pushes.) Back! (Lucky takes a step back.) Further!
(Lucky takes another step back.) Stop! (Lucky stops. To Vladimir and Estragon.) That is why, with your permission, I propose to dally with 1 or moment, before I venture any further. Basket!
(Lucky advances, gives the basket, goes back to his place.) The fresh air stimulates the jaded appetite. (He opens the basket, takes out a piece of chicken and a bottle of wine.) Basket! (Lucky advances, picks up the basket, goes back to his place.) Further! (Lucky takes a step back.) He stinks. Happy days!
He drinks from the bottle, puts it down and begins to eat. Silence. Vladimir and Estragon, cautiously at first, then more boldly, begin to circle about Lucky, inspecting him up and down. Pozzo eats his chicken voraciously, throwing away the bones after having sucked them. Lucky sags slowly, until bag and basket touch the ground, then straightens up with a start and begins to sag again. Rhythm of one sleeping on his feet.
ON.
What ails him?
IR. He looks tired.
ON. Why doesn't he put down his bags?
IR. How do I know? (They close in on him.) Careful!
ON. Say something to him.
IR. Look!
ON. What?
IR. (pointing). His neck!
N. (looking at his neck). I see nothing.
IR. Here.
Estragon goes over beside Vladimir.
N.
Oh I say.
IR. A running sore!
N. It's the rope.
R. It's the rubbing.
N. It's inevitable.
R. It's the knot.
N.
It's the chafing.
They resume their inspection, dwell on the face.
R.
(grudgingly). He's not bad looking,
N. (shrugging his shoulders, wry face). Would you say so?
VLADIMIR.
A trifle effeminate.
ESTRAGON.
Look at the Slobber, ja liva
VLADIMIR.
It's inevitable.
ESTRAGON.
Look at the slaver.
VLADIMIR. Perhaps he's a half-wit.
ESTRAGON. A cretin.
VLADIMIR. (looking closer). It looks like a goitre.
боле
ESTRAGON. (ditto). It's not certain.
VLADIMIR. He's panting.
ESTRAGON. It's inevitable.
VLADIMIR. And his eyes!
ESTRAGON.
What about them?
VLADIMIR.
Goggling out of his head.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Looks at his last gasp to me.
It's not certain. (Pause.) Ask him a question.
ESTRAGON.
Would that be a good thing?
VLADIMIR.
What do we risk?
ESTRAGON.
timidly). Mister...
VLADIMIR.
Louder.
ESTRAGON.
(louder). Mister...
POZZO.
Leave him in peace! (They turn towards Pozzo, who, having finished eating, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand.) Can't you see he wants to rest? Basket! (He strikes a match, and begins to light his pipe. Estragon sees the chicken bones on the ground and stares at them greedily. As Lucky does not move Pozzo throws the match angrily away and jerks the rope.) Basket! (Lucky starts, almost falls, recovers his senses, advances, puts the bottle in the basket, returns to his place. Estrago stares at the bones. Pozzo strikes another match and lights his pipe.) What can you expect, it's not his job. (He pulls at his pipe, stretches out his legs.) Ah! That's better.
ESTRAGON. (timidly), Please, sir...
POZZO. What is it, my good man?
ESTRAGON. Er ... you've finished with the ... er... you don't need the ... er ... bones, sir?
DIMIR. (scandalized). You couldn't have waited?
POZZO.
No no, he does well to ask. Do I need the bones?
(He turns them over with the end of his whip.)
No, personally I do not need them any more.
(Estragon takes a step towards the bones.) But...
(Estragon stops short). but in theory the bones go to the carrier. He is therefore the one to ask.
(Estragon turns towards Lucky, hesitates.) Go on, go on, don't be afraid, ask him, he'll tell you.
Estragon goes towards Lucky, stops before him.
TRAGON. Mister... excuse me, Mister...
POZZO. You're being spoken to, pig! Reply! (To Estragon.)
Try him again.
TRAGON.
Excuse me, Mister, the bones, you won't be wanting the bones?
Lucky looks long at estragon.
POZZO.
(in raptures). Mister! (Lucky bows his head.)
Reply! Do you want them or don't you? (Silence of Lucky. To Estragon.) They're yours. (Estragon makes a dart at the bones, picks them up and begins to gnaw them.) I don't like it. I've never known him refuse a bone before. (He looks anxiously at Lucky.) Nice business it'd be if he fell sick on me!
He puffs at his pipe.
ADIMIR.
(exploding). Its a scandal!
Silence. Flabbergasted, Estragon stops gnawing, looks at Pozzo and Vladimir in turn. Pozzo outwardly calm. Vladimir embarrassed.
POZZO.
(to Vladimir). Are you alluding to anything in particular?
ADIMIR.
(stutteringly resolute). To treat a man... gesture towards Lucky) ... like that... I think that... no... a human being... no... it's a scandal!
TRAGON.
(not to be outdone) A disgrace!
) N
He resumes his gnawing.
POZZO. You are severe. (To Vladimir.) What age are you,
if it's not a rude question. (Silence.) Sixty?
Seventy? (To Estragon.) What age would you s he was?
ESTRAGON.
POZZO.
Eleven.
I am impertinent. (He knocks out his pipe ago, the whip, gets up.) I must be getting on. Thank you for your society. He reflects) Unless I sm another pipe before I go. What do you say? (Th say nothing.) Oh I'm only a small smoker, a ven small smoker, I'm not in the habit of smoking in pipes one on top of the other, it makes handt heart, sighing) my heart go pit-a-pat. (Silence. r the nicotine, one absorbs it in spite of one s precautions. (Sighs.) You know how it is. (Silence, But perhaps you don't smoke? Yes? No? It's of m importance. (Silence.) But how am I to sit down now, without affectation, now that I have risen?
Without appearing to-how shall I say—withou appearing to falter. (To Vladimir.) I beg your pardon? (Silence.) Perhaps you didn't speak?
(Silence.) It's of no importance. Let me see...
He reflects.
ESTRAGON. Ah! That's better.
He puts the bones in his pocket.
VLADIMIR. Let's go.
ESTRAGON. So soon?
POZZO. One moment. (He jerks the rope.) Stool! (He points with his whip. Lucky moves the stool.) More! There! (He sits down. Lucky goes back to his place.) Done it!
He fills his pipe.
VLADIMIR.
(vehemently). Let's go!
POZZO. I hope I'm not driving you away. Wait a little longer, you'll never regret it.
ESTRAGON.
(scenting charity). We're in no hurry.
POZZO.
(having lit his pipe). The second is never so swee ... (he takes the pipe out of his mouth, contemplates it) ... as the first, I mean. (He puts the pipe back in his mouth.) But it's sweet just the same.
ADIMIR.
POZZO.
I'm going.
He can no longer endure my presence. I am perhaps not particularly human, but who cares?
(To Vladimir.) Think twice before you do anything rash. Suppose you go now, while it is still day, for there is no denying it is still day. (They all look up at the sky.) Good. (They stop looking at the sky.) What happens in that case — he takes the pipe out of his mouth, examines it)—I'm out-he relights his pipe)-in that case-(puff) -in that case-(puff)-what happens in that case to your appointment with this.. Godet... Godot..
Godin... anyhow you see who I mean, who has your future in his hands.. (pause) ... at least your immediate future.
ADIMIR.
Who told you?
POZZO. He speaks to me again! If this goes on much longer we'll soon be old friends.
TRAGON. Why doesn't he put down his bags?
POZZO. I too would be happy to meet him. The more
people I meet the happier I become. From the meanest creature one departs wiser, richer, more conscious of one's blessings. Even you... he looks at them ostentatiously in turn to make it clear they are both meant)... even you, who knows, will have added to my store.
'RAGON.
Why doesn't he put down his bags?
POZZO. But that would surprise me.
DIMIR. You're being asked a question.
POZZO.
(delighted). A question! Who? What? A moment ago you were calling me sir, in fear and trembling Now you're asking me questions. No good will come of this!
DIMIR.
RAGON.
DIMIR.
(to Estragon), I think he's listening. (circling about Lucky). WhatP
You can ask him now. He's on the alert.
ESTRAGON. Ask him what?
VLADIMIR. Why he doesn't put down his bags.
ESTRAGON. I wonder.
VLADIMIR.
Ask him, can't you?
POZZO.
(who has followed these exchanges with anxious attention, fearing lest the question get lost). You want to know why he doesn't put down his bags, as you call them?
VLADIMIR.
That's it.
POZZO.
(to Estragon). You are sure you agree with that?
ESTRAGON. He's puffing like a grampus.
POZZO.
The answer is this. (To Estragon.) But stay still, 1 beg of you, you're making me nervous!
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Here.
What is it?
He's about to speak.
Estragon goes over beside Vladimir.
Motionless, side by side, they wait.
POZZO.
Good. Is everybody ready? Is everybody looking at me? (He looks at Lucky, jerks the rope. Lucky raises his head.) Will you look at me, pig! (Lucky looks at him.) Good. (He puts his pipe in his pocket, takes out a little vaporizer and sprays his throat, puts back the vaporizer in his pocket, clears his throat, spits, takes out the vaporizer again, sprays his throat again, puts back the vaporizer in his pocket.) I am ready. Is everybod listening? Is everybody ready? (He looks at them all in turn, jerks the rope.) Hog! (Lucky raises his head.) I don't like talking in a vacuum.
Good. Let me see.
He reflects.
ESTRAGON.
I'm going.
POZZO. What was it exactly you wanted to know?
VLADIMIR. Why he—
POZZO. (angrily). Don't interrupt me! (Pause. Calmer.) If we all speak at once we'll never get anywhere. (Pause.) What was I saying? (Pause.
Louder.) What was I saying?
Vladimir mimics one carrying a heavy burden.
Pozzo looks at him, puzzled.,
TRAGON.
(forcibly). Bags. (He points at Lucky.) Why?
Always hold. (He sags, panting.) Never put down.
(He opens his hands, straightens up with relief.)
Why?
POZZO. Ah! Why couldn't you say so before? Why he
doesn't make himself comfortable? Let's try and get it clear. Has he not the right to? Certainly he has. It follows that he doesn't want to. There's reasoning for you. And why doesn't he want to?
(Pause.) Gentlemen, the reason is this.
LADIMIR. (to Estragon). Make a note of this.
POZZO. He wants to impress me, so that I'll keep him.
STRAGON. What?
POZZO. Perhaps I haven't got it quite right. He wants to
mollify me, so that I'll give up the idea of parting with him. No, that's not exactly it either.
LADIMIR. You want to get rid of him?
POZZO. He wants to cod me, but he won't.
LADIMIR. You want to get rid of him?
POZZO. He imagines that when I see how well he carries I'll be tempted to keep him on in that capacity.
STRACON. You've had enough of him?
POZZO. In reality he carries like a pig. It's not his job.
LADIMIR. You want to get rid of him?
POZZO. He imagines that when I see him indefatigable
I'll regret my decision. Such is his miserable scheme. As though I were short of slaves! (All three look at Lucky.) Atlas, son of Jupiter!
(Silence.) Well, that's that I think. Anything else?
Vaporizer.
(LADIMIR.
POZZO.
You want to get rid of him?
Remark that I might just as well have been in his shoes and he in mine. If chance had not willed otherwise. To each one his due.
VLADIMIR. You waagerrim?
POZZO. I beg your pardon?
VLADIMIR. You want to get rid of him?
POZZO. I do. But instead of driving him away as I might have done, I mean instead of simply kicking him out on his arse, in the goodness of my heart I am bringing him to the fair, where I hope to get a good price for him. The truth is you can't drive such creatures away. The best thing would be to kill them.
Lucky weeps.
ESTRAGON.
He's crying.
POZZO. Old dogs have more dignity. (He proffers his
handkerchief to Estragon.) Comfort him, since y pity him. (Estragon hesitates.) Come on. (Estrag takes the handkerchief.) Wipe away his tears, he' feel less forsaken.
Estragon hesitates.
VLADIMIR.
Here, give it to me, I'll do it.
Estragon refuses to give the handkerchief.
Childish gestures.
POZZO.
Make haste, before he stops. (Estragon approach Lucky and makes to wipe his eyes. Lucky kicks him violently in the shins. Estragon drops the handkerchief, recoils, staggers about the stage howling with pain.)
Hanky!
Lucky puts down bag and basket, picks up handkerchief, gives it to Pozzo, goes back to his place, picks up bag and basket.
ESTRAGON.
Oh the swine! (He pulls up the leg of his trousers He's crippled me!
POZZO.
VLADIMIR.
I told you he didn't like strangers. (to Estragon). Show. (Estragon shows his leg. To Pozzo, angrily.) He's bleeding!
POZZO.
It's a good sign.
ESTRAGON.
(on one leg). I'll never walk again!
VLADIMIR.
(tenderly). I'll carry you. (Pause.) If necessary.
POZZO. He's stopped crying. (To Estragon.) You have replaced him as it were. (Lyrically.) The tears of the world are a constant quantity. For each one who begins to weep, somewhere else another stops. The same is true of the laugh. (He laughs) Let us not then speak ill of our generation, it is not any unhappier than its predecessors. (Pause.) Let
предск
us not speak well of it either. (Pause.) Let us not speak of it at all. (Pause. Judiciously.) It is true the population has increased.
ADIMIR.
Try and walk.
Estragon takes a few limping steps, stops before Lucky and spits on him, then goes and sits down on the mound.
POZZO.
Guess who taught me all these beautiful things.
(Pause. Pointing to Lucky.) My Lucky!
ADIMIR.
(looking at the sky). Will night never come?
POZZO. But for him all my thoughts, all my feelings,
would have been of common things. (Pause. With extraordinary vehemence.) Professional worries!
(Calmer.) Beauty, grace, truth of the first water, I knew they were all beyond me. So I took a look
ADIMIR.
(startled from his inspection of the sky). A knook?
POZZO.
That was nearly sixty years ago.. he consults his watch) ... yes, nearly sixty. (Drawing himself up proudly.) You wouldn't think it to look at me, would you? Compared to him I look like a young man, no? (Pause.) Hat! (Lucky puts down the basket and takes off his hat. His long white hair falls about his face. He puts his hat under his arm and picks up the basket.) Now look. (Pozzo takes off his hat.' He is completely bald. He puts on his hat again.) Did you see?
ADIMIR.
And now you turn him away? Such an old and faithful servant.
RAGON.
Swine!
Pozzo more and more agitated.
' All four wear bowlers.
VLADIMIR. After having sucked all the good out of him you chuck him away like a ... like a banana skin, Really ...
POZZO. (groaning, clutching his head). I can't bear it. any longer... the way he goes on... you've no idea... it's terrible... he must go... (he waves his arms) ... I'm going mad...
• (he
collapses, his head in his hands) ... I can't bear it... any longer...
Silence. All look at Pozzo.
VLADIMIR. He can't bear it.
ESTRAGON. Any longer.
VLADIMIR. He's going mad
ESTRAGON; It's terrible.
VLADIMIR.
(to Lucky). How dare you! It's abominable! Such a good master! Crucify him like that! After so many years. Really!
POZZO. (sobbing). He used to be so kind... so helpful...
and entertaining... my good angel... and now.. he's killing me.
ESTRAGON.
(to Vladimir). Does he want to replace him?
VLADIMIR.
What?
ESTRAGON.
Does he want someone to take his place or not?
VLADIMIR. I don't think so.
ESTRAGON. What?
VLADIMIR. I don't know.
ESTRAGON. Ask him.
POZZO. (calmer). Gentlemen, I don't know what
came over me. Forgive me. Forget all I said. (Mor and more his old self.) I don't remember exactly what it was, but you may be sure there wasn't a word of truth in it. (Drawing himself up, striking his chest.) Do I look like a man that can be made to suffer? Frankly? (He rummages in his pockets.)
What have I done with my pipe?
VLADIMIR.
Charming evening we're having.
ESTRAGON. Unforgettable, VLADIMIR. And it's not over.
ESTRAGON.
Apparently not.
It's only beginning.
VLADIMIR：
ESTRAGON.
It's awful.
Worse than the pantomime.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
The circus.
The music-hall.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
The circus.
POZZO.
What can I have done with that briar?
ESTRAGON.
He's a scream. He's lost his dudeen.
Laughs noisily.
VLADIMIR.
I'll be back.
He hastens towards the wings.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
End of the corridor, on the left.
13
Keep my seat.
Exit Vladimir.
POZZO.
I've lost my Kapp and Peterson!
ESTRAGON.
(convulsed with merriment). He'll be the death of me!
POZZO. (looking up). You didn't by any chance see-He misses Vladimir.) Oh! He's gone! Without saying good-bye! How could be! he might have waited! 
ESTRAGON.
He would have burst.
POZZO.
Oh! (Pause.) Oh well then of course in that case ...
ESTRAGON.
Come here.
POZZO.
What for?
ESTRAGON.
You'll see.
POZZO. You want me to get up?
ESTRAGON. Quick! (Pozzo gets up and goes over beside Estragon. Estragon points off.) Look!
POZZO.
ESTRAGON.
(having put on his glasses). Oh I say!
It's all over.
Enter Vladimir, sombre. He shoulders Lucky out of his way, kicks over the stool, comes and goes agitatedly,
POZZO.
He's not pleased
ESTRAGON. (to Vladimir). You missed a treat. Pity.
Vladimir halts, straightens the stool, comes and goes, calmer.
POZZO.
He subsides. (Looking round.) Indeed all subside A great calm descends. (Raising his hand.) Liste
Pan sleeps.
VLADIMIR.
Will night never come?
All three look at the sky.
kefcpoeuns
POZZO.
You don't feel like going until it does?
ESTRAGON. Well you see-
POZZO. Why it's very natural, very natural. I myself in your situation, if I had an appointment with a Godin.. Godet... Godot... anyhow, you see who I mean, I'd wait till it was black night before I gave up. (He looks at the stool.) I'd like very much to sit down, but I don't quite know how to go about it.
ESTRAGON.
Could I be of any help?
POZZO. If you asked me perhaps.
ESTRAGON. What?
POZZO. If you asked me to sit down.
ESTRAGON. Would that be a help?
POZZO. I fancy so.
ESTRAGON. Here we go. Be seated, sir, I beg of you.
POZZO. No, no, I wouldn't think of it! (Pause. Aside.) Ask
me again.
ESTRAGON. Come come, take a seat, I beseech you, you'll get
pneumonia.
POZZO. You really think so?
ESTRAGON. Why it's absolutely certain.
POZZO. No doubt you are right. (He sits down.) Done it again! (Pause.) Thank you, dear fellow. (He consults his watch.) But I must really be getting along, if I am to observe my schedule.
VLADIMIR.
Time has stopped.
POZZO.
(cuddling his watch to his ear). Don't you believe it, sir, don't you believe it. (He puts his watch back in his pocket.) Whatever you like, but not that.
ESTRAGON. (to Pozzo). Everything seems black to him today.
POZZO.
Except the firmament! (He laughs, pleased with this witticism.) But I see what it is, you are not from these parts, you don't know what our twilights can do. Shall I tell you? (Silence.
Estragon is fiddling with his boot again, Vladimir with his hat.) I can't refuse you. (Vaporizer.) A little attention, if you please. (Vladimir and Estragon continue their fiddling, Lucky is half asleep. Pozzo cracks his whip feebly.) What's the matter with this whip? (He gets up and cracks it more vigorously, finally with success. Lucky jumps.
Vladimir's hat, Estragon's boot, Lucky's hat, fall to the ground. Pozzo throws down the whip.)
Worn out, this whip. (He looks at Vladimir and Estragon.) What was I saying?
VLADIMIR.
STRAGON.
Let's go.
But take the weight off your feet, I implore you, you'll catch your death.
POZZO.
True. (He sits down, To Estragon.) What is your name?
STRAGON.
POZZO.
Adam.
(who hasn't listened). Ah, yes! The night. (He raises his head.) But be a little more attentive, for pity's sake, otherwise we'll never get anywhere.
(He looks at the sky.) Look. (All look at the sky except Lucky who is dozing off again. Pozzo jerks the rope.) Will you look at the sky, pig! (Lucky looks at the sky.) Good, that's enough. (They stop looking at the sky.) What is there so extraordinary about it? Qua sky. It is pale and luminous like any sky at this hour of the day. (Pause.) In these latitudes. (Pause.) When the weather is fine.
(Lyrical.) An hour ago (he looks at his watch, prosaic) roughly (lyrical) after having poured forth ever since (he hesitates, prosaic) say ten o'clock in the morning (lyrical) tirelessly torrents of red and white light it begins to lose its effulgence, to grow pale (gesture of the two hands lapsing by stages) pale, ever a little paler, a little paler unti (dramatic pause, ample gesture of the two hands fung wide apart) pppl finished it comes to res But—(hand raised in admonition) - but behind this veil of gentleness and peace night is charging (vibrantly) and will burst upon us (snaps his fingers) pop! like that! his inspiration leaves him) just when we least expect it. (Silence. Gloomily.)
That's how it is on this bitch of an earth.
Long silence.
ESTRAGON. So long as one knows.
VLADIMIR. One can bide one's time.
ESTRAGON. One knows what to expect.
VLADIMIR. No further need to worry.
ESTRAGON. Simply wait.
VLADIMIR. We're used to it.
He picks up his hat, looks inside it, shakes it, puts it on.
POZZO. How did you find me? (Vladimir and Estragon look at him blankly.) Good Fair? Middling?
Poor? Positively bad?
VLADIMIR. first to understand). Oh very good, very very
good.
POZZO. (to Estragon). And you, sir?
ESTRAGON. Oh tray bong, tray tray tray bong.
POZZO. (fervently). Bless you, gentlemen, bless you!
(Pause.) I have such need of encouragement!
(Pause.) I weakened a little towards the end, you didn't notice?
VLADIMIR. Oh perhaps just a teeny weeny little bit.
ESTRAGON. I thought it was intentional.
POZZO. You see my memory is defective.
Silence.
ESTRAGON. In the meantime nothing happens.
POZZO. You find it tedious?
ESTRAGON. Somewhat.
POZZO. (to Vladimir), And you, sir?
VLADIMIR. I've been better entertained.
Silence. Pozzo struggles inwardly.
hos
Gentlemen, you have been... civil to me.
to,
POZZO.
Not at all.
hingTRAGON.
What an idea!
AADIMIR：
S
POZZO.
Yes yes, you have been correct. So that I ask myself is there anything I can do in my turn for these honest fellows who are having such a dull, dull time.
ISTRAGON.
Even ten francs would be welcome.
LADIMIR.
We are not beggars!
POZZO.
Is there anything I can do, that's what I ask myself, to cheer them up? I have given them bones, I have talked to them about this and that, I have explained the twilight, admittedly. But is it enough, that's what tortures me, is it enough?
ESTRAGON.
Even five.
VLADIMIR.
(to Estragon, indignantly). That's enough!
ESTRAGON.
I couldn't accept less.
POZZO. Is it enough? No doubt. But I am liberal. It's my nature. This evening. So much the worse for me.
(He jerks the rope. Lucky looks at him.) For I shall suffer, no doubt about that. (He picks up the whip.) What do you prefer? Shall we have him dance, or sing, or recite, or think, or—
ESTRAGON.
Who?
POZZO.
Who! You know how to think, you two?
VLADIMIR.
He thinks?
POZZO. Certainly. Aloud. He even used to think very prettily once, I could listen to him for hours.
Now ... (he shudders). So much the worse for me.
Well, would you like him to think something for us?
ESTRAGON.
I'd rather he'd dance, it'd be more fun?
POZZO.
Not necessarily.
ESTRAGON.
Wouldn't it, Didi, be more fun?
VLADIMIR.
I'd like well to hear him think.
ESTRAGON.
Perhaps he could dance first and think afterwards, if it isn't too much to ask him.
VLADIMIR. (to Pozzo). Would that be possible?
POZZO.
By all means, nothing simpler. It's the natural order.
He laughs briefly.
VLADIMIR.
Then let him dance.
Silence.
POZZO.
ESTRAGON.
POZZO.
Do you hear, hog?
He never refuses?
He refused once. (Silence.) Dance, misery!
Lucky puts down hat and basket, advances towards front, turns to Pozzo. Lucky dances. He stops.
ESTRAGON.
Is that all?
POZZO.
Encore! s
Lucky executes the same movements, stops.
ESTRAGON.
Pooh! I'd do as well myself. (He imitates Lucky, almost falls.) With a little practice.
POZZO.
He used to dance the farandole, the fling, the brawl, the jig, the fandango, and even the hornpipe. He capered. For joy. Now that's the best he can do. Do you know what he calls it?
ESTRAGON.
The Scapegoat's Agony.
VLADIMIR.
The Hard Stool.
POZZO.
The Net. He thinks he's entangled in a net.
VLADIMIR! (squirming like an aesthete). There's something
about it...
Lucky makes to return to his burdens.
POZZO.
Woaa!
Lucky stiffens.
ESTRAGON.
POZZO.
Tell us about the time he refused
With pleasure, with pleasure. He fumbles in his pockets.) Wait. (He fumbles.) What have I done with my spray? (He fumbles.) Well now isn't that... (He looks up, consternation on his features. Faintly.) I can't find my pulverizer!
ESTRAGON.
(faintly). My left lung is very weak! (He coughs feebly. In ringing tones.) But my right lung is as sound as a bell!
POZZO. (normal voice). No matter! What was I saying.
(He ponders.) Wait. (Ponders.) Well now isn't that... (He raises his head). Help mel
STRAGON.
Wait!
LADIMIR. Wait!
POZZO. Wait!
All three take off their hats simultaneously, press their hands to their foreheads, concentrate.
STRAGON. (triumphantly). Ah!
LADIMIR. He has it.
POZZO. (impatient). WellP
STRAGON.
Why doesn't he put down his bags?
LADIMIR. Rubbish!
POZZO. Are you sure?
LADIMIR. Damn it, Haven't you already told us!
POZZO. I've already told you?
STRAGON. He's already told us?
LADIMIR. Anyway he has put them down.
STRAGON. (glance at Lucky). So he has. And what of it?
VLADIMIR. Since he has put down his bags it is impossible
we should have asked why he does not do so.
POZZO. Stoutly reasoned!
ESTRAGON. And why has he put them down?
POZZO. Answer us that.
VLADIMIR. In order to dance.
ISTRAGON. True!
POZZO. True!
Silence. They put on their hats.
ESTRAGON.
Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!
VLADIMIR.
POZZO.

PLADIMIR.
(to Pozzo). Tell him to think.
Give him his hat.
His hat?
He can't think without his hat. (to Estragon). Give him his hat.
Me! After what he did to me! Never!
I'll give it to him.
He does not move.
ESTRAGON. (to Pozzo). Tell him to go and fetch it.
POZZO. It's better to give it to him.
VLADIMIR.
I'll give it to him.
He picks up the hat and tenders it at arm's leng to Lucky, who does not move.
POZZO.
You must put it on his head.
ESTRAGON. (to Pozzo). Tell him to take it.
POZZO. It's better to put it on his head.
VLADIMIR. I'll put it on his head.
He goes round behind Lucky, approaches him cautiously, puts the hat on his head and recoils smartly. Lucky does not move. Silence.
ESTRAGON. What's he waiting for?
POZZO. Stand back! (Vladimir and Estragon move away from Lucky. Pozzo jerks the rope. Lucky looks a Pozzo.) Think, pig! (Pause. Lucky begins to dance.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Forward! (Lucky advances.) Stop! (Lucky stops.) Think!
Silence.
LUCKY: On the other hand with regard to-POZZO. Stop! (Lucky stops.) Back! (Lucky moves back.)
Stop! (Lucky stops.) Turn! (Lucky turns towards auditorium.) Think!
During Lucky's tirade the others react as follows
(1) Vladimir and Estragon all attention, Pozz0 dejected and disgusted. (2) Vladimir and Estrag begin to protest, Pozzo's sufferings increase. (3) Vladimir and Estragon attentive again, Pozzo m and more agitated and groaning. (4) Vladimir an Estragon protest violently. Pozzo jumps up, pull on the rope. General outcry. Lucky pulls on the rope, staggers, shouts his text. All three throw themselves on Lucky who struggles and shouts 1 text.

POZZO.
so calm... Cunard... unfinished...
His hat!
Vladimir seizes Lucky's hat. Silence of Lucky. He falls. Silence. Panting of the victors.
ESTRAGON.
Avenged!
Vladimir examines the hat, peers inside it.
POZZO.
Give me that! (He snatches the hat from Vladimir, throws it on the ground, tramples on it.) There's an end to his thinking!
VLADIMIR. But will he be able to walk?
POZZO. Walk or crawl! (He kicks Lucky.) Up pig!
ESTRAGON. Perhaps he's dead. igh VLADIMIR. You'll kill him.
POZZO. Up scum! (He jerks the rope.) Help me!
b VLADIMIR. How?
POZZO. Raise him up!
Vladimir and Estragon hoist Lucky to his feet, support him an instant, then let him go. He falls.
he ESTRAGON.
He's doing it on purpose!
POZZO. You must hold him. (Pause.) Come on, come on,
raise him up!
ESTRAGON. To hell with him!
VLADIMIR. Come on, once more.
ESTRAGON.
What does he take us for?
They raise Lucky, hold him up.
POZZO.
Don't let him go! (Vladimir and Estragon totter.) Don't move! (Pozzo fetches bag and basket and brings them towards Lucky.) Hold him tight! (He puts the bag in Lucky's hand. Lucky drops it immediately.) Don't let him go! (He puts back the bag in Lucky's hand. Gradually, at the feel of the bag, Lucky recovers his senses and his fingers close round the handle.) Hold him tight!
(As before with basket.) Now! You can let him go.
(Vladimir and Estragon move away from Lucky, who totters, reels, sags, but succeeds in remaining on his feet, bag and basket in his hands. Pozzo steps back, cracks his whip.) Forward! (Lucky totters forward.) Back! (Lucky totters back.) Turn! (Lucky turns.) Done it! He can walk, (Turning towards Vladimir and Estragon.) Thank you gentlemen, and let me... he fumbles in his pockets) ... let me wish you... (fumbles) ... wish you.. (fumbles) ... what have I done with my watch? (Fumbles.) A genuine half-hunter, gentlemen, with deadbeat escapement! (Sobbing)
'Twas my granpa gave it to me! (He searches on the ground, Vladimir and Estragon likewise.
Pozzo turns over with his foot the remains of Lucky's hat.) Well now, isn't that just—
VLADIMIR.
POZZO.
Perhaps it's in your fob.
Wait! (He doubles up in an attempt to apply his ear to his stomach, listens. Silence.) I hear nothing (He beckons them to approach. Vladimir and Estragon go towards him, bend over his stomach.)
Surely one should hear the tick-tick.
VLADIMIR.
Silence!
All listen, bent double.
ESTRAGON.
I hear something.
POZZO.
Where?
VLADIMIR. It's the heart.
POZZO. (disappointed). Damnation!
VLADIMIR.
Silence!
ESTRAGON. Perhaps it has stopped.
They straighten up.
POZZO.
Which of you smells so bad?
ESTRAGON. He has stinking breath and I have stinking feet.
POZZO. I must go.
ESTRAGON. And your half-hunter?
POZZO. I must have left it at the manor.
Silence.
ESTRAGON. Then adieu.

Thank you.
POZZO.
Not at all.
STRAGON.
Yes yes.
POZZO. No no.
LADIMIR. Yes yes.
STRAGON. No no.
Silence,
POZZO. I don't seem to be able... (long hesitation) ... to
depart.
STRAGON. Such is life.
Pozzo turns, moves away from Lucky towards the wings, paying out the rope as he goes.
LADIMIR. You're going the wrong way.
POZZO. I need a running start. (Having come to the end of the rope, i.e. off stage, he stops, turns, and cries.) Stand back! (Vladimir and Estragon stand back, look towards Pozzo. Crack of whip.) On! On!
STRAGON. On!
VLADIMIR. On!
Lucky moves off.
POZZO. Faster! (He appears, crosses the stage preceded by Lucky. Vladimir and Estragon wave their hats.
Exit Lucky.) On! On! (On the point of disappearing in his turn he stops and turns. The rope tautens. Noise of Lucky falling off.) Stool!
(Vladimir fetches stool and gives it to Pozzo, who throws it to Lucky.) Adieu!
LADIMIR
STRAGON
(waving). Adieu! Adieu!
POZZO. Up! Pig! (Noise of Lucky getting up.) On! Exit Pozzo.) Faster! On! Adieul Pig! Yip! Adieul Long silence.
VLADIMIR.

That passed the time.
It would have passed in any case.
Yes, but not so rapidly.
Pause.

What do we do now?
I don't know.
Let's go.
We can't.
Why not?
We're waiting for Godot. (despairingly). Ah!

VLADIMIR.
How they've changed!
Who?
Those two.
That's the idea, let's make a little conversation.
Haven't they?
What?
Changed.
Very likely. They all change. Only we can't.
Likely! It's certain. Didn't you see them?
I suppose I did. But I don't know them.
Yes you do know them.
No I don't know them.
We know them, I tell you. You forget everything (Pause. To himself.) Unless they're not the same ..
ESTRAGON.
Why didn't they recognize us then?
VLADIMIR. That means nothing. I too pretended not to
recognize them. And then nobody ever recognizes
us.
ESTRAGON. Forget it. What we need-Ow! (Vladimir does
not react.) Ow!
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
(to himself). Unless they're not the same...
Didi! It's the other foot!
He goes hobbling towards the mound.
Unless they re not the same...
VLADIMIR.
BOY.
(off). Mister!
Estragon halts. Both look towards the voice.
ESTRAGON.
Off we go again.
NADIMIR.
Approach, my child.
Enter Boy, timidly. He halts.
BOY.
Mister Albert... P VLADIMIR. Yes.
ASTRAGON. What do you want?
VLADIMIR.
Approach.
The Boy does not move.
ESTRAGON. (forcibly). Approach when you're told, can't
The Boy advances timidly, halts.
VLADIMIR.
What is it?
BOY.
Mr. Godot...
VLADIMIR.
Obviously ... (Pause.) Approach.
ESTRAGON.
(violently). Will you approach! (The Boy advances
ОП,
timidly.) What kept you so late?
VLADIMIR. You have a message from Mr. Godot?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. Well, what is it?
ESTRAGON.
What kept you so late?
The Boy looks at them in turn, not knowing to which he should reply.
VLADIMIR. (to Estragon). Let him alone.
ESTRAGON. (violently). You let me alone! (Advancing, to the Boy.) Do you know what time it is?

BOY. I was afraid, sir.
lizes
ESTRAGON. Afraid of what? Of us? (Pause.) Answer me!
VLADIMIR. I know what it is, he was afraid of the others.
ESTRACON. How long have you been here?
BOY.
A good while, sir,
VLADIMIR.
You were afraid of the whip.
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. The roars.
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR.
The two big men.
BOY.
Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. Do you know them?
BOY. No, sir.
VLADIMIR. Are you a native of these parts? (Silence.) Do you belong to these parts?
BOY.
ESTRAGON.
Yes, sir.
That's all a pack of lies. (Shaking the Boy by the arm.) Tell us the truth.
BOY.
VLADIMIR.
(trembling). But it is the truth, sir!
Will you let him alone! What's the matter with you? (Estragon releases the Boy, moves away, covering his face with his hands. Vladimir and the Boy observe him. Estragon drops his hands. His face is convulsed.) What's the matter with you?
ESTRAGON. I'm unhappy.
VLADIMIR. Not really! Since when?
ESTRAGON. I'd forgotten.
VLADIMIR. Extraordinary the tricks that memory plays!
(Estragon tries to speak, renounces, limps to his place, sits down and begins to take off his boots.
To Boy.) Well?
BOY.
Mr. Godot—
VLADIMIR. I've seen you before, haven't I?
BOY. I don't know, sir.
VLADIMIR.
You don't know me?
BOY.
No, sir.
VLADIMIR. It wasn't you came yesterday?
BOY. No, sir.
VLADIMIR. This is your first time?.
BOY. Yes, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
Words, words. (Pause.) Speak.
BOY. (in a rush). Mr. Godot told me to tell you he won't come this evening but surely tomorrow.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. Is that allP
BOY.
Yes, sir.
Silence.
You work for Mr. Godot?
VLADIMIR.
BOY.
Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR.
What do you do?
BOY. I mind the goats, sir.
VLADIMIR. Is he good to you?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR.
He doesn't beat you?
BOY.
No, sir, not me.
VLADIMIR.
Whom does he beat?
BOY. He beats my brother, sir.
VLADIMIR. Ah, you have a brother?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. What does he do?
BOY. He minds the sheep, sir.
VLADIMIR. And why doesn't he beat you?
BOY. I don't know, sir.
VLADIMIR. He must be fond of you.
BOY. I don't know, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. Does he give you enough to eat? (The Boy hesitates.) Does he feed you well?
BOY. Fairly well, sir.
VLADIMIR. You're not unhappy? (The Boy hesitates.) Do you
hear me?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. Well?
BOY. I don't know, sir.
VLADIMIR. You don't know if you're unhappy or not?
BOY. No, sir.
VLADIMIR.
You're as bad as myself. (Silence.) Where do you sleep?
BOY. In the loft, sir.
VLADIMIR. With your brother?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. In the hay?
BOY. Yes, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
All right, you may go.
BOY. What am I to say to Mr. Godot, sir?
VLADIMIR.
Tell him... (he hesitates) .. tell him you saw a (Pause.) You did see us, didn't you?
BOY.
Yes, sir.
He steps back, hesitates, turns and exit running. The light suddenly fails. In a moment it is night.
The moon rises at back, mounts in the sky, stands still, shedding a pale light on the scene.
VLADIMIR.
At last! (Estragon gets up and goes towards Vladimir, a boot in each hand. He puts them down, at the edge of stage, straightens and contemplates the moon.) What are you doing?
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Pale for weariness.
Eh?
Of climbing heaven and gazing on the likes of us.
Your boots. What are you doing with your boots? (turning to look at the boots). I'm leaving them there. (Pause.) Another will come, just as ...as ... as me, but with smaller feet, and they'll make him happy.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
But you can't go barefoot!
Christ did.
Christ! What's Christ got to do with it? You're not going to compare yourself to Christ!
ESTRAGON.
All my life I've compared myself to him.
VLADIMIR. But where he lived it was warm, it was dry!
ESTRAGON. Yes. And they crucified quick.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
We've nothing more to do here.
Nor anywhere else.
Ah Gogo, don't go on like that. Tomorrow everything will be better.
ESTRAGON.
How do you make that out?
VLADIMIR.
Did you not hear what the child said?
ESTRAGON. No.
He said that Godot was sure to come tomorrow.
LADIMIR.
(Pause.) What do you say to that?
Then all we have to do is to wait on here.
STRAGON;
Are you mad? We must take cover. (He takes
LADIMIR.
Estragon by the arm.) Come on.
He draws Estragon after him. Estragon yields, then resists. They halt.
STRAGON.
(looking at the tree). Pity we haven't got a bit of rope.
LADIMIR.
Come on. It's cold.
He draws Estragon after him. As before.
STRAGON.
Remind me to bring a bit of rope tomorrow.
LADIMIR.
Yes. Come on.
He draws him after him. As before.
STRAGON. How long have we been together all the time
now?
LADIMIR. I don't know. Fifty years perhaps.
STRAGON. Do you remember the day I threw myself into
the Rhône?
VLADIMIR. We were grape-harvesting.
STRAGON. You fished me out.
VLADIMIR.
That's all dead and buried.
ESTRAGON. My clothes dried in the sun.
VLADIMIR.
There's no good harking back on that. Come on.
He draws him after him. As before.
ESTRAGON. Wait.
VLADIMIR. I'm cold!
STRAGON. Wait! (He moves away from Vladimir.) I wonder if we wouldn't have been better off alone, each one for himself. (He crosses the stage and sits down on the mound.) We weren't made for the same road.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
(without anger). It's not certain.
No, nothing is certain.
Vladimir slowly crosses the stage and sits down beside Estragon.
VLADIMIR.
We can still part, if you think it would be better.
ESTRAGON. It's not worth while now.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
No, it's not worth while now.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Well, shall we go?
Yes, let's go.
They do not move.
CURTAIN
Estragon's boots front centre, heels together, toes splayed. Lucky's hat at same place.
The tree has four or fie leaves.
Enter Vladimir agitatedly. He halts and looks long at the tree, then suddenly begins to move feverishly about the stage. He halts before the boots, picks one up, examines it, sniffs it, manifests disgust, puts it back carefully. Comes and goes.
Halts extreme right and gazes into distance off, shading his eyes with his hand. Comes and goes.
Halts extreme left, as before. Comes and goes.
Halts suddenly and begins to sing loudly.
A dog came in—
Having begun too high he stops, clears his throat, resumes.
A dog came in the kitchen And stole a crust of bread.
Then cook up with a ladle And beat him till he was dead.
Then all the dogs came running And dug the dog a tomb-He stops, broods, resumes:
Then all the dogs came running
And dug the dog a tomb And wrote upon the tombstone For the eyes of dogs to come:
A dog came in the kitchen And stole a crust of bread.
Then cook up with a ladle And beat him till he was dead.
Then all the dogs came running And dug the dog a tomb-He stops, broods, resumes:
Then all the dogs came running And dug the dog a tomb—
He stops, broods. Softly.
And dug the dog a tomb...
He remains a moment silent and motionless, then begins to move feverishly about the stage. He halts before the tree, comes and goes, before the boots, comes and goes, halts extreme right, gazes into distance, extreme left, gazes into distance.
Enter Estragon right, barefoot, head bowed. He slowly crosses the stage. Vladimir turns and sees him.
VLADIMIR.
You again! (Estragon halts, but does not raise his head. Vladimir goes towards him.) Come here till I embrace you.
ESTRAGON.
Don't touch me!
Vladimir holds back, pained.
VLADIMIR. Do you want me to go away? (Pause.) Gogo!
(Pause. Vladimir observes him attentively.) Did they beat you? (Pause.) Gogo! (Estragon remains silent, head bowed.) Where did you spend the night?
ESTRAGON.
Don't touch me! Don't question me! Don't speak to me! Stay with me!
VLADIMIR.
Did I ever leave you?
ESTRAGON. You let me go.
VLADIMIR.
Look at me. (Estragon does not raise his head.
Violently.) Will you look at me!
Estragon raises his head. They look long at each other, then suddenly embrace, clapping each other on the back. End of the embrace. Estragon, no longer supported, almost falls.
What a day!
FRAGON.
Who beat you? Tell me.
HADIMIR.
Another day done with.
TRAGON.
LADIMIR.
Not yet.
For me it's over and done with, no matter what
STRAGON.
happens. (Silence.) I heard you singing.
That's right, I remember.
ZADIMIR.
That finished me. I said to myself, he's all alone,
ASTRAGON.
he thinks I'm gone for ever, and he sings.
LADIMIR.
One isn't master of one's moods. All day I've felt in great form. (Pause.) I didn't get up in the night, not once!
ESTRAGON.
(sadly). You see, you piss better when I'm not there.
VADIMIR.
I missed you... and at the same time I was happy.
Isn't that a queer thing?
ESTRAGON.
(shocked). Happy?
ZADIMIR. Perhaps it's not the right word.
HESTRAGON. And now?
VLADIMIR.
Now? ..: (Joyous.) There you are again...
(Indifferent.) There we are again.. (Gloomy.)
There I am again.
ESTRAGON.
You see, you feel worse when I'm with you. I feel better alone, too.
VLADIMIR.
(vexed). Then why do you always come crawling back?
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
I don't know.
No, but I do. It's because you don't know how to defend yourself. I wouldn't have let them beat you.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
You couldn't have stopped them.
Why not?
There were ten of them.
No, I mean before they beat you. I would have stopped you from doing whatever it was you were doing.
STRAGON.
LADIMIR.
I wasn't doing anything.
Then why did they beat you?
ESTRAGON. I don't know.
VLADIMER. Ah no, Gogo, the truth is there are things escape you that don't escape me, you must feel it yourself.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
I tell you I wasn't doing anything.
Perhaps you weren't. But it's the way of doing i that counts, the way of doing it, if you want to go on living.
ESTRAGON. I wasn't doing anything.
VLADIMIR. You must be happy, too, deep down, if you only
knew it.
ESTRAGON. Happy about what?
VLADIMIR. To be back with me again.
ESTRACON. Would you say so?
VLADIMIR.
Say you are, even if it's not true.
ESTRAGON.
What am I to say?
VLADIMIR.
Say, I am happy.
ESTRAGON.
I am happy.
VLADIMIR.
So am I.
ESTRAGON.
So am I.
VLADIMIR.
We are happy.
ESTRAGON.
We are happy. (Silence.) What do we do now, now that we are happy?
VLADIMIR.
Wait for Godot. (Estragon groans. Silence.) Things have changed since yesterday.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
And if he doesn't come?
(after a moment of bewilderment). We'll see when the time comes. (Pause.) I was saying that things have changed here since yesterday.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Everything oozes.
Look at the tree.
It's never the same pus from one second to the next.
VLADIMIR.
The tree, look at the tree.
Estragon looks at the tree.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Was it not there yesterday?
Yes, of course it was there. Do you not remember?
We nearly hanged ourselves from it. But you wouldn't. Do you not remember?
ASTRAGON.
You dreamt it.
Is it possible that you've forgotten already?
LADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
That's the way I am. Either I forget immediately or I never forget.
LADIMIR.
And Pozzo and Lucky, have you forgotten them too?
ESTRAGON.
Pozzo and Lucky?
VLADIMIR.
He's forgotten everything!
ESTRAGON.
I remember a lunatic who kicked the shins off me.
Then he played the fool.
VLADIMIR.
That was Lucky.
ESTRAGON.
I remember that. But when was it?
VLADIMIR.
And his keeper, do you not remember him?
ESTRAGON.
He gave me a bone.
VLADIMIR.
That was Pozzo.
STRAGON. And all that was yesterday, you say?
VLADIMIR.
Yes, of course it was yesterday.
ESTRAGON.
And here where we are now?
VLADIMIR.
Where else do you think? Do you not recognize the place?
STRAGON.
(suddenly furious). Recognize! What is there to recognize? All my lousy life I've crawled about in the mud! And you talk to me about scenery!
(Looking wildly about him.) Look at this muckheap! I've never stirred from it!
LADIMIR.
Calm yourself, calm yourself.
STRAGON. You and your landscapes! Tell me about the
worms!
LADIMIR.
All the same, you can't tell me that this (gesture) bears any resemblance to ... (he hesitates) ... to the Macon country, for example. You can't deny there's a big difference.
TRAGON.
The Macon country! Who's talking to you about the Macon country?
LADIMIR.
But you were there yourself, in the Macon country.
ESTRAGON. No, I was never in the Macon country. T've puked my puke of a life away here, I tell you! Here! In the Cackon country!
VLADIMIR.
But we were there together, I could swear to it Picking grapes for a man called
1... (he snaps his
fingers) .., can't think of the name of the man, at a place called... (snaps his fingers)... can't think of the name of the place, do you not remember?
ESTRACON. (a little calmer). It's possible. I didn't notice
anything.
VLADIMIR. But down there everything is red!
ESTRAGON.
(exasperated). I didn't notice anything, I tell you!
Silence. Vladimir sighs deeply.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
You're a hard man to get on with, Gogo.
It'd be better if we parted.
You always say that, and you always come crawling back.
ESTRAGON.
The best thing would be to kill me, like the other.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
What other? (Pause.) What other?
Like billions of others.
(sententious). To every man his little cross. (He sighs.) Till he dies. (Afterthought.) And is forgotten.
ESTRAGON. In the meantime let us try and converse calmly, since we are incapable of keeping silent.
VLADIMIR. You're right, we're inexhaustible.
ESTRAGON. It's so we won't think.
VLADIMIR. We have that excuse.
ESTRAGON. It's so we won't hear.
VLADIMIR. We have our reasons.
ESTRAGON. All the dead voices.
VLADIMIR. They make a noise like wings.
ESTRAGON. Like leaves.
VLADIMIR. Like sand.
ESTRAGON. Like leaves.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. They all speak together.
STRAGON.
MADIMIR.
ASTRAGON.
NADIMIR.
HESTRAGON.
Each one to itself.
Silence.
Rather they whisper.
They rustle.
They murmur.
They rustle.
Silence.
VADIMIR.
What do they say?
ESTRAGON.
They talk about their lives.
VLADIMIR.
To have lived is not enough for them.
ESTRAGON.
They have to talk about it.
VLADIMIR.
To be dead is not enough for them.
ESTRAGON. It is not sufficient.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. They make a noise like feathers.
ESTRAGON. Like leaves.
VLADIMIR. Like ashes.
ESTRAGON. Like leaves.
Long silence.
VLADIMIR. Say something!
ESTRAGON. I'm trying.
Long silence.
VLADIMIR. (in anguish). Say anything at all!
ÉSTRAGON. What do we do now?
VLADIMIR. Wait for Godot.
ESTRAGON. Ah!
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
This is awful!
STRACON. Sing something.
VLADIMIR.
No no! (He reflects.) We could start all over again perhaps.
ESTRAGON.
That should be easy.
VLADIMIR. It's the start that's difficult.
ESTRACON. You can start from anything.
VLADIMIR. Yes, but you have to decide.
ESTRAGON.
True.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. Help me!
ESTRAGON. I'm trying.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. When you seek you hear.
ESTRAGON. You do.
VLADIMIR.
That prevents you from finding.
ESTRAGON. It does.
VLADIMIR. That prevents you from thinking.
ESTRAGON. You think all the same.
VLADIMIR. No, no, impossible.
ESTRACON. That's the idea, let's contradict each other.
VLADIMIR. Impossible.
ESTRAGON. You think so?
VLADIMIR. We're in no danger of ever thinking any more.
ESTRAGON. Then what are we complaining about?
VLADIMIR. Thinking is not the worst.
ESTRAGON. Perhaps not. But at least there's that.
VLADIMIR. That what?
ESTRAGON. That's the idea, let's ask each other questions.
VLADIMIR. What do you mean, at least there's that?
ESTRAGON. That much less misery.
VLADIMIR.
True.
ESTRAGON. Well If we gave thanks for our mercies?
VLADIMIR. What is terrible is to have thought.
ESTRAGON. But did that ever happen to us?
VLADIMIR. Where are all these corpses from?
ESTRAGON.
These skeletons.
VLADIMIR.
Tell me that.
ESTRAGON.
True.
VLADIMIR.
We must have thought a little.
ESTRAGON. At the very beginning
VLADIMIR. A charnel-house! A charnel-house!
ESTRAGON. You don't have to look.
VLADIMIR. You can't help looking
ESTRAGON.
True.
VLADIMIR.
Try as one may.
ESTRAGON. I beg your pardon?
VLADIMIR. Try as one may.
ESTRAGON. We should turn resolutely towards Nature.
VLADIMIR. We’ve tried that!
True.
Oh, it's not the worst, I know.
What?
To have thought.
Obviously.
But we could have done without it.
Que voulez-vous?
I beg your pardon?
Que voulez-vous?
Ah! que voulez-vous. Exactly.
Silence.
ESTRAGON. That wasn't such a bad little canter.
VLADIMIR. Yes, but now we'll have to find something
else.
ESTRAGON.
Let me see.
He takes off his hat, concentrates.
I VLADIMIR.
Let me see. (He takes off his hat, concentrates.
Long silence.) Ah!
They put on their hats, relax.
ESTRAGON.
WellP
VLADIMIR.
What was I saying, we could go on from there.
ESTRAGON.
What were you saying when?
VLADIMIR.
At the very beginning.
ESTRAGON. The beginning of WHAT?
VLADIMIR. This evening... I was saying... I was saying...
ESTRAGON. I'm not a historian.
VLADIMIR. Wait... we embraced... we were happy..
happy... what do we do now that we're happy... go on waiting... waiting... let me think .. it's coming. go on waiting. now that we're happy... let me see... ah! The tree!
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
The tree?
Do you not remember?
I'm tired.
Look at it,
They look at the tree.
I see nothing.
VEADIMIR. But yesterday evening with leaves black and bate, And now it's covered with leaves.
ESTRAGON. Leaves?
VLADIMIR. In a single night.
ESTRAGON. It must be the Spring.
VLADIMIR. But in a single night!
ESTRAGON. I tell you we weren't here yesterday. Another of
your nightmares.
VLADIMIR. And where were we yesterday evening according
to you?
ESTRAGON. How do I know? In another compartment. There's
no lack of void.
VIADIMIR. (sure of himself. Good. We weren't here yesterday evening. Now what did we do yesterday evening?
ESTRAGON. Do?
VLADIMIR. Try and remember.
ESTRACON. Do ... I suppose we blathered.
VLADIMIR. (controlling himself). About what?
ESTRAGON. Oh... this and that, I suppose, nothing in
particular. (With assurance.) Yes, now I remember, yesterday evening we spent blathering about nothing in particular. That's been going on now for half a century.
VLADIMIR. Lou don't remember any fact, any circumstance?
ESTRAGON. (weary). Don't torment me, Didi.
VLADIMIR. The sun. The moon. Do you not remember?
ESTRAGON. They must have been there, as usual.
VLADIMIR. You didn't notice anything out of the ordinary?
ESTRAGON. Alas!
VLADIMIR. And Pozzo? And Lucky?
ESTRAGON. Pozzo?
VLADIMIR. The bones.
ESTRAGON. They were like fishbones.
VLADIMIR. It was Pozzo gave them to you.
ESTRACON. I don't know.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
And the kick.
VLADIMIR. It was Lucky gave it to you.
That's right, someone gave me a kick.
And all that was yesterday?
RAGON.
Show your leg.
DIMIR.
RACON.
Which?
DIMIR.
Both. Pull up your trousers. (Estragon gives a leg to Vladimir, staggers. Vladimir takes the leg. They stagger.) Pull up your trousers.
RAGON.
I can't.
Vladimir pulls up the trousers, looks at the leg, lets it go. Estragon almost falls.
DIMIR.
The other. (Estragon gives the same leg.) The other, pig! (Estragon gives the other leg.
Triumphantly.) There's the wound! Beginning to fester!
KRAGON.
And what about it?
NADIMIR.
(letting go the leg). Where are your boots?
ARAGON. I must have thrown them away.
ADIMIR. When?
INTRAGON. I don't know.
MADIMIR.
Why?
STRAGON. (exasperated). I don't know why I don't know!
LADIMIR.
No, I mean why did you throw them away?
ISTRAGON. (exasperated). Because they were hurting me!
LADIMIR.
(triumphantly, pointing to the boots). There they are! (Estragon looks at the boots.) At the very spot where you left them yesterday!
Estragon goes towards the boots, inspects them closely.
ESTRAGON.
They re not mine.
MADIMIR. (stupefied). Not yours!
STRAGON. Mine were black. These are brown.
VLADIMIR.
You're sure yours were black?
STRAGON.
Well, they were a kind of grey.
LADIMIR.
And these are brown? Show.
STRAGON.
(picking up a boot). Well, they're a kind of green.
LADIMIR.
Show. (Estragon hands him the boot.
Vladimir inspects it, throws it down angrily.) Well of all the—
TRACON. You see, all that's a lot of bloody—
VEADIMIR. Ahl I see what it is. Yes, I see what's happened, ESTRAGON. All that's a lot of bloody—
VLADIMIR. It's elementary. Someone came and took yours
and left you his.
ESTRAGON. Why?
VLADIMIR. His were too tight for him, so he took yours, ESTRAGON. But mine were too tight.
VLADIMIR. For you. Not for him.
ESTRAGON. (having tried in vain to work it out). I'm tired!
(Pause.) Let's go.
VLADIMIR.
We can't.
ESTRAGON. Why not?
VLADIMIR. Were waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON. Ahl (Pause. Despairing.) What'll we do, whatl
we do!
VLADIMIR. There's nothing we can do.
ESTRAGON. But I can't go on like this! • VLADIMIR. Would you like a radish?
ESTRAGON. Is that all there is?
VLADIMIR. There are radishes and turnips.
ESTRAGON. Are there no carrots?
VLADIMIR. No. Anyway you overdo it with your carrots.
ESTRAGON. Then give me a radish. (Vladimir fumbles in his
pockets, finds nothing but turnips, finally brings out a radish and hands it to Estragon, who examines it, sniffs it.) It's black!
VLADIMIR. It's a radish.
ESTRAGON. I only like the pink ones, you know that!
VLADIMIR.
Then you don't want it?
ESTRAGON.
I only like the pink ones!
VLADIMIR.
Then give it back to me.
Estragon gives it back.
ESTRAGON.
I'll go and get a carrot.
He does not move.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
This is becoming really insignificant.
Not enough.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
What about trying them?
RACON. T've tried everything.
YADIMIR.
No, I mean the boots.
STRAGON.
Would that be a good thing?
MADIMIR.
It'd pass the time. (Estragon hesitates.) I assure you, it'd be an occupation.
ESTRAGON.
A relaxation.
VLADIMIR.
A recreation.
ESTRAGON. A relaxation.
VLADIMIR.
Try.
ESTRAGON. You'll help me?
VLADIMIR. I will of course.
ESTRAGON. We don't manage too badly, eh Didi, between
the two of us?
VLADIMIR. Yes yes. Come on, we'll try the left first.
ESTRAGON. We always find something, eh Didi, to give us the
impression we exist?
VLADIMIR. (impatiently). Yes yes, we're magicians. But let us persevere in what we have resolved, before we forget. (He picks up a boot.) Come on, give me your foot. (Estragon raises his foot.) The other, hog! (Estragon raises the other foot.) Higher!
(Wreathed together they stagger about the stage.
Vladimir succeeds finally in getting on the boot.)
Try and walk. (Estragon walks.) Well?
ESTRAGON. It fits.
VLADIMIR. (taking string from his pocket). We'll try and
lace it.
ESTRAGON. (vehemently). No no, no laces, no laces!
VLADIMIR.
You'll be sorry. Let's try the other. (As before.)
Well?
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
(grudgingly). It fits too.
They don't hurt you?
Not yet.
Then you can keep them.
They re too big.
Perhaps you'll have socks some day.
True,
Then you'll keep them?
ESTRAGON. That's enough about these boots.
VLADIMIR. Yes, but—
ESTRAGON. (violently). Enoughl (Silence.) I suppose I might
as well sit down.
He looks for a place to sit down, then goes and sits down on the mound.
VLADIMIR. That's where you were sitting yesterday evening.
ESTRAGON. If I could only sleep.
VLADIMIR. Yesterday you slept.
ESTRAGON. I'll try.
He resumes his fetal posture, his head between his knees.
VLADIMIR. Wait. (He goes over and sits down beside
Estragon and begins to sing in a loud voice.)
Bye bye bye bye Bye bye—
ESTRAGON. (looking up angrily). Not so loud!
VLADIMIR.
(softly).
Bye bye bye bye Bye bye bye bye Bye bye bye bye Bye bye...
(Estragon sleeps. Vladimir gets up softly, takes off his coat and lays it across Estragon's shoulders, then starts walking up and down, swinging his arms to keep himself warm. Estragon wakes with a start, jumps up, casts about wildly. Vladimir runs to him, puts his arms round him.) There... there ... Didi is there... don't be afraid...
ESTRAGON. Ah!
VLADIMIR. There... there ... it's all over.
ESTRAGON. I was falling—
VLADIMIR. It's all over, it's all over.
ESTRAGON. I was on top of a—
VLADIMIR. Don't tell me! Come, we'll walk it off.
He takes Estragon by the arm and walks him up and down until Estragon refuses to go any further
ESTRAGON. That's enough. I'm tired.
DIMIR. You'd rather be stuck there doing nothing? 
RAGON. Yes?
DIMIR. Please yourself.
He releases Estragon, picks up his coat and puts it on.
RAGON.
Let's go.
DIMIR.
We can't.
RAGON.
Why not?
DIMIR.
We're waiting for Godot.
RAGON.
Ah! (Vladimir walks up and down.) Can you not stay still?
ADIMIR.
I'm cold.
RAGON. We came too soon.
ADIMIR. It's always at nightfall.
RAGON. But night doesn't fall.
ADIMIR. It'll fall all of a sudden, like yesterday.
FRAGON. Then it'll be night.
ADIMIR. And we can go.
RAGON. Then it'll be day again. (Pause. Despairing.)
What'll we do, what'll we do!
ADIMIR. (halting, violently). Will you stop whining! I've had about my bellyful of your lamentations!
TRAGON. I'm going.
ADIMIR. (seeing Lucky's hat). Well!
TRAGON. Farewell.
ADIMIR. Lucky's hat. (He goes towards it.) I've been here an hour and never saw it. (Very pleased.) Fine!
TRAGON.
ADIMIR.
You'll never see me again.
I knew it was the right place. Now our troubles are over. (He picks up the hat, contemplates it, straightens it.) Must have been a very fine hat.
(He puts it on in place of his own which he hands to Estragon.) Here.
TRAGON.
ADIMIR.
What?
Hold that.
Estragon takes Vladimir's hat. Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat on his head. Estragon puts on Vladimir's hat in place of his own which he hands
to Vladimir. Vladimir takes Estragon's hat.
Estragon adjusts Vladimir's hat on his head.
Vladimir puts on Estragon's hat in place of Lucky which he hands to Estragon. Estragon takes Lucky's hat. Vladimir adjusts Estragon's hat on he head. Estragon puts on Lucky's hat in place of Vladimir's which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes his hat. Estragon adjusts Lucky's hat on his head. Estragon puts on Lucky's hat in place of Estragon's which he hands to Estragon. Estragon takes his hat. Vladimir adjusts his hat on his head, Estragon puts on his hat in place of Lucky's which he hands to Vladimir. Vladimir takes Lucky's hat.
Estragon adjusts his hat on his head. Vladimir puts on Lucky's hat in place of his own which he hand. to Estragon. Estragon takes Vladimir's hat.
Vladimir adjusts Lucky's hat on his head.
Estragon hands Vladimir's hat back to Vladimir who takes it and hands it back to Estragon who takes it and hands it back to Vladimir who takes it and throws it down.
How does it fit me?
ESTRAGON. How would I know?
VLADIMIR.
No, but how do I look in it?
He turns his head coquettishly to and fro, minces like a mannequin.
ESTRAGON. Hideous.
VLADIMIR. Yes, but not more so than usual?
ESTRAGON. Neither more nor less.
VLADIMIR.
Then I can keep it. Mine irked me. (Pause.) How shall I say? (Pause.) It itched me.
He takes off Lucky's hat, peers into it, shakes it, knocks on the crown, puts it on again.
ESTRAGON.
I'm going.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
Will you not play?
ESTRAGON.
Play at whatP
VLADIMIR.
We could play at Pozzo and Lucky.
RAGON. Never heard of it.
MOTMIR. F'll do Lucky, you do Pozzo. He imitates Lucky sagging under the weight of his baggage.
Estragon looks at him with stupefaction.) Go on.
TRAGON.
What am I to do?
MADIMIR.
Curse me!
STRAGON. (after reflection). Naughty!
RADIMIR. Stronger!
STRAGON.,
Gonococcus! Spirochete!
Vladimir sways back and forth, doubled in two.
LADIMIR.
Tell me to think.
STRAGON. What?
ADIMIR. Say, Think, pig!
ESTRAGON. Think, pig!
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
I can't!
ESTRAGON. That's enough of that.
VLADIMIR. Tell me to dance.
ESTRAGON. I'm going.
VLADIMIR.
Dance, hog! (He writhes. Exit Estragon left, precipitately.) I can't! (He looks up, misses Estragon.) Gogo! (He moves wildly about the stage. Enter Estragon left, panting. He hastens towards Vladimir, falls into his arms.) There you are again at last!
ESTRAGON. I'm accursed!
VLADIMIR.
Where were you? I thought you were gone for ever.
ESTRAGON.
They're coming!
VLADIMIR.
Who?
ESTRAGON. I don't know.
VLADIMIR. How many?
ESTRAGON. I don't know.
VLADIMIR.
(triumphantly). It's Godot! At last! Gogo! It's Godot! We're saved! Let's go and meet him! (He drags Estragon towards the wings. Estragon resists, pulls himself free, exit right.) Gogo! Come back! (Vladimir runs to extreme left, scans the horizon. Enter Estragon right, he hastens towards Vladimir, falls into his arms.) There you are again again!
ESTRAGON. I'm in hell!
VLADIMIR. Where were you?
ESTRAGON. They're coming there too!
VLADIMIR. We're surrounded! (Estragon makes a rush
towards back.) Imbecile! There's no way out there. (He takes Estragon by the arm and drags him towards front. Gesture towards front.)
There! Not a soul in sight! Off you go. Quick!
(He pushes Estragon towards auditorium.
Estragon recoils in horror.) You won't (He contemplates auditorium.) Well, I can understand that. Wait till I see. (He reflects.) Your only hope left is to disappear.
ESTRAGON. Where?
VLADIMIR. Behind the tree. (Estragon hesitates.) Quick!
Behind the tree. (Estragon goes and crouches behind the tree, realizes he is not hidden, comes out from behind the tree.) Decidedly this tree will not have been of the slightest use to us.
ESTRAGON. (calmer). I lost my head. Forgive me. It won't happen again. Tell me what to do.
VLADIMIR. There's nothing to do.
ESTRAGON. You go and stand there. (He draws Vladimir to
extreme right and places him with his back to the stage.) There, don't move, and watch out.
(Vladimir scans horizon, screening his eyes with his hand. Estragon runs and takes up same position, extreme left. They turn their heads and look at each other.) Back to back like in the good old days! (They continue to look at each other for a moment, then resume their watch. Long silence.)
Do you see anything coming?
VLADIMIR. (turning his head). What?
ESTRAGON; (louder). Do you see anything coming?
VLADIMIR. No.
ESTRAGON.
NADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
MADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Nor I.
They resume their watch. Silence.
You must have had a vision. (turning his head). What?
(louder). You must have had a vision!
No need to shout!
They resume their watch. Silence.
VLADIMIR ESTRAGON S
(turning simultaneously.) Do you—
VLADIMIR.
Oh, pardon!
ESTRAGON. Carry on.
VLADIMIR. No no, after you.
STRAGON. No no, you first.
VLADIMIR. I interrupted you.
ESTRAGON. On the contrary.
They glare at each other angrily.
VLADIMIR.
Ceremonious ape!
ESTRAGON. Punctilious pig!
VLADIMIR. Finish your phrase, I tell you!
ESTRAGON. Finish your own!
Silence. They draw closer, halt.
VLADIMIR.
Moron!
STRAGON. That's the idea, let's abuse each other.
They turn, move apart, turn again and face each other.
VLADIMIR. Moron!
STRAGON. Vermin!
LADIMIR. Abortion!
STRACON. Morpion!
LADIMIR. Sewer-fat!
STRAGON. Curate!
LADIMIR. Cretin!
STRAGON. (with finality). Critic!
LADIMIR.
Oh!
He wilts, vanquished, and turns away.
STRAGON. Now let's make it up.
LADIMIR. Gogo!
STRAGON. Didi!
VLADIMIR. Your hand!
ESTRAGON. Take it!
VLADIMIR. Come to my arms!
ESTRAGON. Your arms?
VLADIMIR.
My breast!
ESTRAGON.
Off we go!
They embrace. They separate. Silence.
VLADIMIR.
How time flies when one has fun!
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
What do we do now?
While waiting.
While waiting.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
We could do our exercises.
Our movements.
Our elevations.
Our relaxations.
Our elongations.
Our relaxations.
To warm us up.
To calm us down.
Off we go.
Vladimir hops from one foot to the other.
Estragon imitates him.
ESTRAGON.
(stopping). That's enough. I'm tired.
VLADIMIR. (stopping). We're not in form. What about a little
deep breathing?
ESTRAGON. I'm tired breathing.
VLADIMIR.
You're right. (Pause.) Let's just do the tree, for the balance.
ESTRAGON.
The tree?
Vladimir does the tree, staggering about on one leg.
VLADIMIR.
(stopping). Your turn.
Estragon does the tree, staggers.
ESTRAGON.|
Do you think God sees me?
VLADIMIR.
You must close your eyes.
Estragon closes his eyes, staggers worse.
AGON.
(stopping, brandishing his fists, at the top of his voice). God have pity on mel
DIMIR.
(vexed). And me?
AGON.
On mel On me! Pity! On mel Enter Pozzo and Lucky. Pozzo is blind. Lucky burdened as before. Rope as before, but much shorter, so that Pozzo may follow more easily.
Lucky wearing a different hat. At the sight of Vladimir and Estragon he stops short. Pozzo, continuing on his way, bumps into him.
DIMIR.
Gogo!
OZZO: (clutching on to Lucky who staggers). What is it?
Who is it?
Lucky falls, drops everything and brings down Pozzo with him. They lie helpless among the scattered baggage.
RAGON. Is it Godot?
DIMIR. At last! (He goes towards the heap.) Reinforce-
ments at last!
POZZO. Help!
RAGON. Is it Godot? /
DIMIR. We were beginning to weaken. Now we're sure
to see the evening out.
POZZO. Help!
RAGON. Do you hear him?
DIMIR. We are no longer alone, waiting for the night, waiting for Godot, waiting for ... waiting. All evening we have struggled, unassisted. Now it's over. It's already tomorrow.
POZZO. Help!
DIMIR. Time flows again already. The sun will set, the moon will rise, and we away... from here.
POZZO. Pity!
DIMIR.
Poor Pozzo!
RAGON. I knew it was him.
ADIMIR.
Who?
CRAGON. Godot.
VLADIMIR. But it's not Godot.
ESTRAGON. It's not Godot?
VLADIMIR. It's not Godot.
ESTRAGON.
Then who is it?
VLADIMIR. It's Pozzo.
POZZO. Here! Here! Help me up!
VLADIMIR. He can't get up.
ESTRAGON. Let's go.
VLADIMIR. We can't.
ESTRAGON. Why not?
VLADIMIR. We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON. Ah!
VLADIMIR. Perhaps he has another bone for you.
ESTRACON. Bone?
VLADIMIR. Chicken. Do you not remember?
ESTRACON. It was him?
VLADIMIR. Yes.
ESTRAGON. Ask him.
VLADIMIR.
Perhaps we should help him first.
ESTRACON.
To do what?
VLADIMIR.
To get up.
ESTRAGON.
He can't get up?
VLADIMIR.
He wants to get up.
ESTRAGON.
Then let him get up.
VLADIMIR.
He can't.
ESTRAGON.
Why not?
VLADIMIR.
I don't know.
Pozzo writhes, groans, beats the ground with his fists.
ESTRAGON.
We should ask him for the bone first. Then if he refuses we'll leave him there.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
You mean we have him at our mercy?
And that we should subordinate our good offices to certain conditions.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
What?
That seems intelligent all right. But there's one thing I'm afraid of.
POZZO. Help!
DRAGON. What?
ADIMIR. That Lucky might get going all of a sudden. Then
we'd be blocked.
STRAGON. Lucky?
LADIMIR. He's the one who went for you yesterday.
STRAGON. I tell you there was ten of them.
MADIMIR. No, before that, the one that kicked you.
STRAGON. Is he there?
LADIMIR. As large as life. (Gesture towards Lucky.) For the
moment he is inert. But he might run amuck any minute.
POZZO. Help!
ASTRAGON. And suppose we gave him a good beating, the
two of us?
VLADIMIR. You mean if we fell on him in his sleep?
ESTRAGON. Yes.
VLADIMIR. That seems a good idea all right. But could we do
it? Is he really asleep? (Pause.) No, the best would be to take advantage of Pozzo's calling for help-
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR. To help him-ESTRAGON. We help him?
VLADIMIR. In anticipation of some tangible return.
ESTRAGON. And suppose he—
VLADIMIR. Let us not waste our time in idle discourse!
(Pause. Vehemently.) Let us do something, while we have the chance! It is not every day that we are needed. Not indeed that we personally are needed. Others would meet the case equally well, if not better. To all mankind they were addressed, those cries for help still ringing in our ears! But at this place, at this moment of time, all mankind is us, whether we like it or not. Let us make the most of it, before it is too late! Let us represent worthily for once the foul brood to which a cruel fate consigned us! What do you say? (Estragon says nothing.) It is true that when with folded arms we weigh the pros and cons we are no less a credit to our species. The tiger bounds to the help of his congeners without the least reflection, or else he slinks away into the depths of the thickets. But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed in this, that we happen to know the answer. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come-
ESTRAGON. Ah!
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR. Or for night to fall. (Pause.) We have kept our
appointment, and that's an end to that. We are not saints, but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much?
ESTRAGON. Billions.
VLADIMIR. You think so?
ESTRAGON. I don't know.
VLADIMIR. You may be right.
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR. All I know is that the hours are long, under
these conditions, and constrain us to beguile them with proceedings which-how shall I say —which may at first sight seem reasonable, until they become a habit. You may say it is to prevent our reason from foundering. No doubt. But has it not long been straying in the night without end of the • abyssal depths? That's what I sometimes wonder.
You follow my reasoning?
ESTRAGON.
(aphoristic for once). We all are born mad. Some remain so.
POZZO.
Help! I'll pay you!
ESTRAGON. How much?
POZZO. One hundred francs!
ESTRAGON. It's not enough.
VLADIMIR. I wouldn't go so far as that.
ESTRAGON. You think it's enough?
VLADIMIR. No, I mean so far as to assert that I was weak in
the head when I came into the world. But that is not the question.
POZZO.
ADIMIR.
Two hundred!
We wait. We are bored. (He throws up his hand.)
No, don't protest, we are bored to death, there's no denying it. Good. A diversion comes along and what do we do? We let it go to waste. Come, let's get to work! (He advances towards the heap, stops in his stride.) In an instant all will vanish and we'll be alone once more, in the midst of nothingness!
He broods.
POZZO.
Two hundred!
NADIMIR. We're coming!
He tries to pull Pozzo to his feet, fails, tries again, stumbles, falls, tries to get up, fails.
ESTRAGON. What's the matter with you all?
VLADIMIR. Help!
ESTRAGON. I'm going.
VLADIMIR. Don't leave me! They'll kill me!
POZZO. Where am IP
VLADIMIR. Gogo!
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR. Help!
ESTRAGON. I'm going.
VLADIMIR.
Help me up first. Then we'll go together.
ESTRAGON. You promise?
VLADIMIR. I swear it!
ESTRAGON. And we'll never come back?
VLADIMIR.
Never!
ESTRAGON.
We'll go to the Pyrenees.
VLADIMIR.
Wherever you like.
ESTRAGON. I've always wanted to wander in the Pyrenees.
VLADIMIR. You'll wander in them.
ESTRAGON. (recoiling). Who farted? прнуть, напгруеть
VLADIMIR. Pozzo.
POZZO. Here! Here! Pity!
ESTRAGON. It's revolting!
VLADIMIR. Quick! Give me your hand.
ESTRAGON.
I'm going. (Pause. Louder.) I'm going.
VLADIMIR.
Well I suppose in the end I'll get up by myself. (He tries, fails.) In the fullness of time.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
What's the matter with you?
Go to hell.
Are you staying there?
For the time being.
Come on, get up, you'll catch a chill.
Don't worry about me.
Come on, Didi, don't be pig-headed.
He stretches out his hand which Vladimir makes haste to seize.
VLADIMIR.
Pull!
Estragon pulls, stumbles, falls. Long silence.
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR.
We've arrived.
POZZO.
Who are you?
VLADIMIR.
We are men.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Sweet mother earth!
Can you get up?
I don't know.
Try.
Not now, not now.
Silence.
POZZO.
What happened?
VLADIMIR.
(violently). Will you stop it, you! Pest! He thinks of nothing but himself!
ESTRAGON. What about a little snooze?
VLADIMIR.
Did you hear him? He wants to know what happened!
ESTRAGON.
Don't mind him. Sleep.
Silence.
POZZO. Pityl Pity!
ESTRAGON. (with a start). What is it?
VLADIMIR. Were you asleep?
ESTRAGON. I must have been.
VLADIMIR. It's this bastard Pozzo at it again.
TRAGON. Make him stop it. Kick him in the crotch.
LADIMIR.
(striking Pozzo). Will you stop it! Crablousel (Pozzo extricates himself with cries of pain and crawls away. He stops, saws the air blindly, calling for help. Vladimir, propped on his elbow, observes his retreat.) He's off! (Pozzo collapses.) He's down!
STRAGON.
What do we do now?
LADIMIR. Perhaps I could crawl to him.
STRAGON. Don't leave me!
LADIMIR. Or I could call to him.
STRAGON. Yes, call to him.
LADIMIR. Pozzo! (Silence.) Pozzo! (Silence.) No reply.
STRAGON. Together.
STRAGON
Pozzo! Pozzo!
VLADIMIR.
VLADIMIR.
He moved.
ESTRAGON. Are you sure his name is Pozzo?
VLADIMIR. (alarmed). Mr. Pozzo! Come back! We won't
hurt you!
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
We might try him with other names.
VLADIMIR.
I'm afraid he's dying.
ESTRAGON.
It'd be amusing.
VLADIMIR. What'd be amusing?
ESTRAGON. To try him with other names, one after the other.
It'd pass the time. And we'd be bound to hit on the right one sooner or later.
VLADIMIR.
I tell you his name is Pozzo.
ESTRAGON. We'll soon see. (He reflects.) Abel! Abel!
POZZO. Help!
ESTRAGON. Got it in one!
VLADIMIR. I begin to weary of this motif.
ESTRAGON. Perhaps the other is called Cain, Cain! Cain!
POZZO. Help!
ESTRAGON.
He's all humanity. (Silence.) Look at the little cloud.
VLADIMIR.
(raising his eyes). Where?
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
There. In the zenith.
WellP (Pause.) What is there so wonderful about it?
Silence.
ESTRAGON./ Let's pass on now to something else, do you
mind?
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
I was just going to suggest it.
But to what?
TR
Ah!
Silence.
TR
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Suppose we got up to begin with.
No harm in trying.
They get up.
11
ESTRAGON.
Child's play.
VLADIMIR.
Simple question of will-power.
ESTRAGON. And now?
TI
POZZO. Help!
ESTRAGON. Let's go.
VLADIMIR. We can't.
ESTRAGON. Why not?
VLADIMIR. We're waiting for Godot.
ESTRAGON.
Ah! (Despairing) What'll we do, what'll we do!
POZZO. Help!
VLADIMIR. What about helping him?
ESTRAGON.
What does he want?
VLADIMIR. He wants to get up.
ESTRAGON. Then why doesn't he?
VLADIMIR. He wants us to help him to get up.
ESTRAGON. Then why don't we? What are we waiting for?
They help Pozzo to his feet, let him go. He falls.
VLADIMIR.
We must hold him. (They get him up again. Pozzo sags between them, his arms round their necks.)
Feeling better?
POZZO.
VLADIMIR.
POZZO.
Who are you?
Do you not recognize us?
I am blind.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
Perhaps he can see into the future.
LADIMIR. Since when?
POZZO. I used to have wonderful sight-but are you
friends?
STRAGON.
(laughing noisily). He wants to know if we are friends!
LADIMIR.
§TRACON.
LADIMIR.
§TRAGON.
No, he means friends of his.
WellP
We've proved we are, by helping him.
LADIMIR.
Exactly. Would we have helped him if we weren't his friends?
Possibly.
§TRAGON. True.
LADIMIR. Don't let's quibble about that now.
POZZO. You are not highwaymen?
ISTRACON. Highwaymen! Do we look like highwaymen?
LADIMIR.
Damn it, can't you see the man is blind!
ESTRAGON. Damn it, so he is. (Pause). So he says.
POZZO.
Don't leave me!
VLADIMIR.
No question of it.
ESTRAGON.
For the moment.
POZZO. What time is it?
VLADIMIR.
(inspecting the sky). Seven o'clock... eight o'clock...
ESTRAGON.
That depends what time of year it is.
POZZO. Is it evening?
Silence. Vladimir and Estragon scrutinize the sunset.
ESTRAGON. It's rising.
VLADIMIR.
Impossible.
ESTRAGON.
Perhaps it's the dawn.
VLADIMIR.
Don't be a fool. It's the west over there.
ESTRAGON.
How do you know?
POZZO.
(anguished). Is it evening?
VLADIMIR.
Anyway it hasn't moved.
ESTRAGON.
I tell you it's rising.
POZZO.
Why don't you answer me?
Give us a chance.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
(reassuring). It's evening, sir, it's evening, night is drawing nigh. My friend here would have me doubt it and I must confess he shook me for a moment. But it is not for nothing I have lived through this long day and I can assure you it is very near the end of its repertory. (Pause.) How do you feel now?
ESTRAGON.
How much longer must we cart him round?
(They half release him, catch him again as he falls.) We are not caryatids!
VLADIMIR.
You were saying your sight used to be good, if I heard you right.
POZZO. Wonderful Wonderful, wonderful sight
ESTRAGON.  (irritably). Expand! Expand!
VLADIMIR. Let him alone. Can't you see he's thinking of the days when he was happy? (Pause. Memoria praeteritorum bonorum—that must be unpleasant.
ESTRAGON.
We wouldn't know.
VLADIMIR.
And it came on you all of a sudden?
POZZO.
Quite wonderful!
VLADIMIR.
I'm asking you if it came on you all of a sudden.
POZZO.
I woke up one fine day as blind as Fortune.
(Pause.) Sometimes I wonder if I'm not still asleep.
VLADIMIR.
And when was that?
POZZO.
I don't know.
VLADIMIR.
But no later than yesterday—
POZZO.
(violently). Don't question me! The blind have no notion of time. The things of time are hidden from them too.
VLADIMIR.
Well just fancy that! I could have sworn it was just the opposite.
ESTRAGON.
I'm going.
POZZO. Where are we?
VLADIMIR. I couldn't tell you.
POZZO.
It isn't by any chance the place known as the Board?
VLADIMIR. Never heard of it.
POZZO. What is it like?
ADIMIR.
(looking round). It's indescribable. It's like
POZZO.
nothing. There's nothing. There's a tree.
Then it's not the Board.
STRAGON. (sagging). Some diversion!
POZZO. Where is my menial?
ADIMIR. He's about somewhere.
POZZO. Why doesn't he answer when I call?
MADIMIR. I don't know. He seems to be sleeping. Perhaps
he's dead.
POZZO.
What happened exactly?
STRAGON.
Exactly!
HADIMIR. The two of you slipped. (Pause.) And fell.
POZZO. Go and see is he hurt.
VADIMIR. We can't leave you.
POZZO. You needn't both go.
VLADIMIR. (to Estragon). You go.
BSTRAGON. After what he did to me? Never!
POZZO.
Yes yes, let your friend go, he stinks so. (Silence.
What is he waiting for?
VLADIMIR.
What are you waiting for?
ESTRAGON.
I'm waiting for Godot.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
What exactly should he do?
POZZO. Well to begin with he should pull on the rope,
as hard as he likes so long as he doesn't strangle him. He usually responds to that. If not he should give him a taste of his boot, in the face and the privates as far as possible.
VLADIMIR.
(to Estragon). You see, you've nothing to be afraid of. It's even an opportunity to revenge yourself.
And if he defends himself?
ESTRAGON.
POZZO.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
No no, he never defends himself.
I'll come flying to the rescue.
Don't take your eyes off me.
He goes towards Lucky,
Make sure he's alive beforé you start. No point in
VLADIMIR.
exerting yourself if he's dead.
ESTRAGON. (bending over Lucky). He's breathing.
VLADIMIR.
Then let him have it.
With sudden fury Estragon starts kicking Lucky, hurling abuse at him as he does so. But he hurts
Lucky stirs.
his foot and moves away, limping and groaning.
ESTRAGON.
Oh the brute!
He sits down on the mound and tries to take off his boot. But he soon desists and disposes himself for sleep, his arms on his knees and his head on his arms.
POZZO. What's gone wrong now?
VLADIMIR.
My friend has hurt himself.
POZZO. And Lucky?
VLADIMIR. So it is he?
POZZO. What?
VLADIMIR. It is Lucky?
POZZO. I don't understand.
VLADIMIR. And you are Pozzo?
POZZO. Certainly I am Pozzo.
VLADIMIR. The same as yesterday?
POZZO. Yesterday?
VLADIMIR. We met yesterday. (Silence.) Do you not
remember?
POZZO. I don't remember having met anyone yesterday.
But tomorrow I won't remember having met anyone today. So don't count on me to enlighten you.
VLADIMIR. But—
POZZO. Enough. Up pig!
VLADIMIR. You were bringing him to the fair to sell him. You spoke to us. He danced. He thought. You had your sight.
POZZO.
As you please. Let me go! (Vladimir moves away.) Up!
Lucky gets up, gathers up his burdens.
VLADIMIR.
Where do you go from here?
POZZO. On. (Lucky, laden down, takes his place before Pozzo.) Whip! (Lucky puts everything down, looks for whip, finds it, puts it into Pozzo's hand, takes up everything again.) Rope!
ADIMIR.
Lucky puts everything down, puts end of the What is there in the bag?
rope into Pozzo's hand, takes up everything again.
POZZO. Sand. (He jerks the rope.) On!
ADIMIR. Don't go yet!
POZZO. I'm going.
ADIMIR.
POZZO.
What do you do when you fall far from help?
SADIMIR. Before you go tell him to sing!
We wait till we can get up. Then we go on. On!
POZZO. WhoP
SADIMIR. Lucky.
POZZO. To sing?
LADIMIR. Yes. Or to think. Or to recite.
POZZO. But he's dumb.
LADIMIR. Dumb!
POZZO. Dumb. He can't even groan.
LADIMIR. Dumb! Since when?
POZZO. (suddenly furious. Have you not done tormenting me with your accursed time! It's abominable!
When! When! One day, is that not enough for you, one day like any other day, one day he went dumb, one day I went blind, one day well go deaf, one day we were born, one day we shall die, the same day, the same second, is that not enough for you?
(Calmer.) They give birth astride of a grave, the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more.
(He jerks the rope.) On!
Exeunt Pozzo and Lucky. Vladimir follows them to the edge of the stage, looks after them. The noise of falling, reinforced by mimic of Vladimir, announces that they are down again. Silence.
Vladimir goes towards Estragon, contemplates him a moment, then shakes him awake.
STRAGON.
(wild gestures, incoherent words, Finally). Why will you never let me sleep?
VLADIMIR. I felt lonely.
ESTRAGON. I was dreaming I was happy.
VLADIMIR. That passed the time.
ESTRAGON. I was dreaming that—
VLADIMIR.
(violently). Don't tell mel (Silence.) I wonder is he really blind.
ESTRAGON.
Blind? Who?
VLADIMIR. Pozzo.
ESTRAGON. Blind?
VLADIMIR. He told us he was blind.
ESTRAGON. Well what about it?
VLADIMIR. It seemed to me he saw us.
ESTRAGON. You dreamt it. (Pause.) Let's go. We can't. Ahl (Pause.) Are you sure it wasn't him?
VLADIMIR. Who?
ESTRAGON. Godot.
VLADIMIR. But who?
ESTRAGON. Pozzo.
VLADIMIR. Not at all! (Less sure.) Not at all! (Still less sure.)
Not at all!
ESTRAGON. I suppose I might as well get up. (He gets up painfully.) Ow! Didi!
VLADIMIR. I don't know what to think any more.
ESTRAGON. My feet! (He sits down, tries to take off his boots.
Help me!
VLADIMIR. Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I
sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, or think I do, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon my friend, at this place, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? That Pozzo passed, with his carrier, and that he spoke to us? Probably. But in all that what truth will there be? (Estragon, having struggled with his boots in vain, is dozing off again. Vladimir stares at him.) He'll know nothing. He'll tell me about the blows he received and I'll give him a carrot. (Pause.) Astride of a grave and a difficult birth. Down in the hole, lingeringly, the grave-digger puts on the forceps. We have time to grow old.
The air is full of our cries. (He listens.) But habit is a great deadener. (He looks again at Estragon.) At me too someone is looking, of me too someone is saying, He is sleeping, he knows nothing, let him sleep on. (Pause.) I can't go on! (Pause.) What have I said?
He goes feverishly to and fro, halts finally at extreme left, broods. Enter Boy right. He halts.
Silence.
BOY.
Mister... (Vladimir turns.) Mr. Albert...
ADIMIR. Off we go again. (Pause.) Do you not recognize
me?
BOY. No, sir.
ADIMIR. It wasn't you came yesterday.
BOY. No, sir.
LADIMIR.
This is your first time.
BOY.
Yes, sir.
Silence.
LADIMIR.
You have a message from Mr. Godot.
BOY. Yes, sir.
LADIMIR. He won't come this evening.
BOY. No, sir.
LADIMIR.
But he'll come tomorrow.
BOY.
Yes, sir.
LADIMIR.
Without fail.
BOY.
Yes, sir.
Silence.
LADIMIR.
Did you meet anyone?
BOY.
No, sir.
LADIMIR.
Two other... (he hesitates) ... men?
BOY.
I didn't see anyone, sir.
Silence.
LADIMIR.
What does he do, Mr. Godot? (Silence.) Do you hear me?
Yes sir.
BOY.
LADIMIR.
BOY.
Well?
He does nothing, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
How is your brother?
BOY. He's sick, sir.
VLADIMIR. Perhaps it was he came yesterday.
BOY. I don't know, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR. (softly). Has he a beard, Mr. Godot?
BOY. Yes, sir.
VLADIMIR. • Fair or ... (he hesitates) ... or black? -
BOY. I think it's white, sir.
Silence.
VLADIMIR.
Christ have mercy on us!
Silence.
BOY. What am I to tell Mr. Godot, sir?
VLADIMIR.
Tell him ... (he hesitates) ... tell him you saw me and that... (he hesitates) ... that you saw me.
(Pause. Vladimir advances, the Boy recoils.
Vladimir halts, the Boy halts. With sudden violence.) You're sure you saw me, you won't come and tell me tomorrow that you never saw m Silence. Vladimir makes a sudden spring forward the Boy avoids him and exit running. Silence. The sun sets, the moon rises. As in Act I. Vladimir stands motionless and bowed. Estragon wakes, takes off his boots, gets up with one in each hand and goes and puts them down centre front, then goes towards Vladimir.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
What's wrong with you?
Nothing.
I'm going.
So am I.
Was I long asleep?
I don't know.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
Where shall we go?
Not far.
Oh yes, let's go far away from here.
We can't.
RAGON. Why not?
DIMIR. We have to come back tomorrow.
RAGON.
What for?
DIMIR.
To wait for Godot.
RAGON. Ah! (Silence.) He didn't come?
DIMIR.
RAGON. And now it's too late.
DIMIR. Yes, now it's night.
RAGON. And if we dropped him? (Pause.) If we dropped
him?
DIMIR. He'd punish us. (Silence. He looks at the tree.)
Everything's dead but the tree.
RAGON. (looking at the tree). What is it?
DIMIR. It's the tree.
RAGON; Yes, but what kind?
DIMIR. I don't know. A willow.
Estragon draws Vladimir towards the tree. They stand motionless before it. Silence.
RAGON.
Why don't we hang ourselves?
DIMIR.
With what?
TRAGON. You haven't got a bit of rope?
DIMIR. No.
RAGON. Then we can't.
Silence.
DIMIR.
Let's go.
RAGON.
Wait, there's my belt.
DIMIR. It's too short.
RAGON. You could hang on to my legs.
DIMIR. And who'd hang on to mine?
RAGON. True.
DIMIR.
Show all the same. (Estragon loosens the cord that holds up his trousers which, much too big for him, fall about his ankles. They look at the cord.) It might do at a pinch. But is it strong enough?
RAGON.
We'll soon see. Here.
They each take an end of the cord and pull. It breaks. They almost fall.
VLADIMIR.
Not worth a curse.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
You say we have to come back tomorrow?
Yes.
Then we can bring a good bit of rope.
Yes.
Silence.
ESTRAGON.
Didi.
VLADIMIR.
Yes.
ESTRAGON.
I can't go on like this.
VLADIMIR.
That's what you think.
ESTRAGON. If we parted? That might be better for us.
VLADIMIR.
We'll hang ourselves tomorrow. (Pause.) Unless
Godot comes.
ESTRAGON.
VLADIMIR.
And if he comes?
We'll be saved.
Vladimir takes off his hat (Lucky's), peers inside it, feels about inside it, shakes it, knocks on the crown, puts it on again.
ESTRAGON.
Well? Shall we go?
VLADIMIR.
Pull on your trousers.
ESTRAGON.
What?
VLADIMIR.
Pull on your trousers.
ESTRAGON.
You want me to pull off my trousers?
VLADIMIR.
Pull on your trousers.
ESTRAGON.
(realizing his trousers are down). True.
He pulls up his trousers.
VLADIMIR.
ESTRAGON.
Well Shall we go?
Yes, let's go.
They do not move.
