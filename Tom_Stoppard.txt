Act One
African sunset.
An open, empty stage, the frame perhaps broken by the branch of a tree. There may be a low skyline but not necessarily. The 'cyc' looks very beautiful. The sun is nearly down. The sky goes through rapid changes towards darkness.
A distant helicopter is heard approaching. By the time it reaches 'overhead', darkness has fallen and there is moonlight.
Helicopter very loud. Shadow of blades whirling on the floor of the stage. Violent shaking of foliage. A spotlight from the helicopter X traverses the stage. It disappears. A jeep drives on to the stage with its headlights on. Not much can be seen in the darkness. Two or three people in the jeep. GUTHRIE is one of the passengers. The jeep turns into the audience so one can only see headlights.
By the time the jep appears, a machine-gun has started up. The noise is all very loud— helicopter and machine-gun. The jeep probably isn't audible. Someone-GUTHRIE-shouts something about the lights, and the jeep's headlights are turned off. The jeep hasn't stopped moving. It is turning in a circle. The spotlight comes back and sweeps across the jeep. GUTHRIE jumps out of the jeep and runs.
He doesn't leave the stage. He just runs out of the light. The light loses the jeep. The jeep goes. GUTHRIE crouches in a down-stage corner. He is shouting but it is hard to catch. He is shouting 'Press!
Press! You stupid fuckers!' Then the spotlight finds him. He stands up into the light with his arms spread out, shouting. The gun is firing bursts. He moves away from the corner. A burst catches him and knocks him over.
A late afternoon light reveals GUTHRIE stretched out on a longgarden chair. Sundown. The steps to the verandah and the room art behind him. The telex is visible and chattering in bursts like the machine-gun; it is apparent that the noise of the telex had entered GUTHRIE's dream in the form of machine-gun fire. This noise has continued right through the transition of the scene. This sound is joined by the sound of an approaching car. The telex stops.
Not far from GUTHRIE's chair is his camera-bag, with pockets for cameras, lenses, exposed and unexposed film, and other small objects, An empty glass is lying near the chair.
GUTHRIE is apparently asleep. FRANCIS enters and removes the empty glass and goes again. The car arrives. The car door slams.
RUTH enters carrying two or three packages which she puts down.
She comes into the room expecting to find somebody there (GUTHRIE's car is outside) and then she sees him on the chair in the garden. She comes down and looks at him curiously. GUTHRIE doesn't move. RUTH notices the bag and bends down and touches it, perhaps to peer inside it.
GUTHRIE. Please don't touch that.
RUTH. I'm sorry.
GUTHRIE. Christ. That wasn't nice at all.
RUTH. I thought you were asleep.
GUTHRIE. I thought I was dead.
(He has barely moved and now doesn't move at all. RUTH looks at him.)
RUTH. Are you all right now? (Pause) That's good. (Pause) I
don't think we've met.
(GUTHRIE half sits up, then relapses.)
GUTHRIE. Uh? Sorry, do you want to sit down?
RUTH. (Drily) Thank you. (She moves up the steps to the small table on the verandah and sits down. GUTHRIE seems to be coming to. He sits up slightly.) You shouldn't sleep in the sun.
(GUTHRIE squints up at the sky.)
GUTHRIE. It moved.
RUTH. It does that. It's called night and day.
(GUTHRIE relapses again. FRANCIS comes on with a tea-tray, a nice tea-set with one cup and saucer. He brings this to RUTH's table, while-
RUTH. I think you're going to like it.
(Sings) Night and day. you are the one? (With her right hand she plays imaginary piano keys on the table. We hear the piano.) 'Only you beneath the moon and under the (A wrong note, caused by FRANCIS placing the cup in the saucer.
He has put the tray on the table in front of RUTH.)
RUTH. Thank you, Francis. Has the house been opened to the public?
FRANCIS. What's that, Mrs Carson?
(This gets through to GUTHRIE.)
GUTHRIE. Oh-God—I'm terribly sorry—
RUTH. I shouldn't get up; you look awful. (To Francis who is
leaving.) Another cup.
(RUTH's manner is easy-going. GUTHRIE gets up.)
GUTHRIE. No-I'm fine. Sleeping on planes-you know. Ruins the complexion. From the inside. (He has come up the steps towards RUTH.) My name's Guthrie-George Guthrie.
RUTH. How do you do? I'm Ruth Carson. Would you care for
some tea?
GUTHRIE. Wouldn't say no.
(RUTH is pouring tea for GUTHRIE into the only cup.)
RUTH. Do you take sugar?
GUTHRIE. No thank you.
(GUTHRIE goes back down the steps to his bag and fishes about in it. Meanwhile FRANCIS comes in with another cup.)
RUTH. (To Francis) Thank you. Would you take those parcels,
Francis?
(GUTHRIE is looking for something-saccharin tablets- in his bag. FRANCIS leaves with the packages.)
I'm sorry I wasn't here to greet you Mr... Guthrie. I had to go into Jeddu to pick up some things.
GUTHRIE. The boy said it was okay to wait in the garden. Is that
all right?
RUTH. Of course. But I'm afraid I have no idea what time
Geoffrey will be home. He's been in Malakuangazi-I was expecting him this afternoon.
GUTHRIE. I've come to meet Dick Wagner. (The name has the English form-Wag-ner. He has found the saccharin and is coming back to the table. RUTH remains perfectly still. GUTHRI comes casually back to the table and sits down. RUTH waits u he looks at her.)
RUTH. What are you talking about, Mr Guthrie?
GUTHRIE. Dick Wagner. Do you know him?
(Pause)
RUTH. Is he a composer?
GUTHRIE. No. He's a reporter. Writes for the Sunday Globe, in London. I take the pictures. The pictures, as you know, are worth a thousand words. In the case of Wagner, two thousand. He was supposed to be at KC to meet me.
RUTH. Why in God's name do you expect to meet him at my
house?
GUTHRIE. He told me. He left a message at the airport.
RUTH. He told you to meet him at my house?
(GUTHRIE, sipping tea, catches her tone for the first time, and hesitates.)
GUTHRIE. Well, he didn't mention you.
(Pause)
RUTH. What kind of camera do you use?
GUTHRIE. Do you know anything about cameras?
RUTH. No. (Pause) By the way, we don't call them boy any more The idea is, if we don't call them boy they won't chop us with their machetes. (Brief smile.) Small point.
(GUTHRIE holds his arm out, palm to the ground.)
GUTHRIE. Boy about this high, fair hair, your mouth, knows about cameras, has a Kodak himself; said I could wait in the garden.
(RUTH acknowledges her mistake, but GUTHRIE pushes it.)
His name's Alastair.
(He has pushed it too far and she snaps at him.)
RUTH. I know his bloody name.
GUTHRIE. (Olive branch) The one I use mainly is a motorized
F2 Nikon. (Sips tea.) Lovely.
RUTH. (Smiles) Would you like a proper drink?
GUTHRIE. (Relaxes; shakes his head) The sambo gave me a lime squash. (Winces) Sorry. (His hand chops the air twice.) Chop-
chop.
(RUTH gets up; moves.)
RUTH. Why is my husband filling my house with journalists?
GUTHRIE. I thought he was one.
RUTH. Geoffrey? Don't be silly.
GUTHRIE. I saw the telex.
RUTH. That's for his business. Did he ask this man to come
here?
GUTHRIE. I don't know.
RUTH. What does he want?
GUTHRIE. I don't know.
RUTH. Help! (Piano chord.)
GUTHRIE. A story maybe.
RUTH. I need somebody-help—
(Piano chord: it's the Beatle's song, 'Help!'.)
GUTHRIE. What is his business?
RUTH. (Picking up the rhythm) Not just anybody—He-e-e-lp!
(Car approaching.)
GUTHRIE. Somebody coming.
(GUTHRIE stands up and moves back into the garden looking out. Piano cuts out.)
RUTH. You're a reasonable looking sort of chap, Guthrie. How would you like to take me away from all this? (New voice.)
My God, Ruth, not a journalist!
(RUTH laughs briefly at herself.)
GUTHRIE. (Reporting from the garden) Beat-up Mercedes. Is that
your husband?
RUTH. It's a taxi.
GUTHRIE. (Looking out) Wagner.
(RUTH leaves. She goes into the house.
Helicopter approaching fast and low. GUTHRIE, in the garden, looks up surprised. He sees the helicopter apparently coming straight at him. He cowers and goes into a crouch, his hands over his head, Shadow whips across the garden. Then the helicopter has gone.
ALASTAIR has entered. He sees GUTHRIE crouched.)
ALASTAIR. What's the matter? Mr Guthrie?
GUTHRIE. Hello.
(ALASTAIR is carrying an old-fashioned leather-bound Kodak.
The camera is folded and ALASTAIR holds it by the strap.
GUTHRIE straightens up.)
Hello.
ALASTAIR. I've found it. Are you going to show me about it?
(The receding helicopter noise has been succeeded by the taxi stopping outside the house. A dog barks, but not for long.
Obscure voices of WAGNER and FRANCIS. Taxi departing.)
GUTHRIE. I think my friend has arrived.
ALASTAIR. I came before but you were asleep.
GUTHRIE. I'm sorry.
ALASTAIR. Will you show me later?
GUTHRIE. Sure.
ALASTAIR. I believe this is an excellent camera. It just needs
some film.
GUTHRIE. When does your daddy get home usually?
ALASTAIR. That was him. The helicopter.
GUTHRIE. Oh.
(Another car drives away from the house.)
ALASTAIR. He buzzes us. Then Francis takes the car down to th
compound to fetch him.
GUTHRIE. The compound?
ALASTAIR. The mine. It's not daddy's own helicopter. He's just allowed to use it. A helicopter is extremely useful in a country like Africa. Have you ever flown in one?
GUTHRIE. Yes, a few times.
ALASTAIR. In Africa?
GUTHRIE. No, in Asia.
ALASTAIR. Well, you know how useful they can be.
GUTHRIE. Yes. This is my friend, Dick Wagner.
(WAGNER has entered.)
WAGNER. (Enthusiastically) Hello Gigi, you lovely bastard! (He moves down into the room and slaps GUTHRIE's shoulder.) You look terrific!
GUTHRIE. I look terrible.
WAGNER. (Fresh start; same tone) You look terrible! How are you?
House is wide open. Is Carson here?
GUTHRIE. This is Alastair Carson.
WAGNER. (Talking down) How do you do, Alastair? And how old
are you?
ALASTAIR. Eight. How old are you?
WAGNER. Kid's a natural.
(Female voice off, not RUTH, 'Allie!'.)
ALASTAIR. Got to have my bath now, anyway. (To GUTHRIE.)
Would you like to look at my camera 'til I get back?
GUTHRIE. Sure.
ALASTAIR. You won't forget?
GUTHRIE. No.
ALASTAIR. I'll come back.
(ALASTAIR goes.)
GUTHRIE. How are things here, Dick?
WAGNER. Not wonderful. Bloody thing won't catch fire. Where's
this Carson?
GUTHRIE. He's on his way. Who is he?
WAGNER. He runs the business end of the copper industry. Also mt
manganese, potash... he's in mines generally.
GUTHRIE. But not frequently.
arg
WAGNER. How about Mrs Carson?
GUTHRIE. She keeps herself nice, too.
WAGNER. Where is she?
GUTHRIE. Inside somewhere. Are you a friend of the family?
WAGNER. Hardly. The one who came out here was an earl or something. Grandfather, I think. There's an elder brother defending the title in England. This one works for a living.
As it were. She's his second wife.
GUTHRIE. What are we doing here?
WAGNER. Looking up Carson.
GUTHRIE. Why?
WAGNER. I don't know. I think Hammaker must know him. the takes a folded cablegram out of his pocket.) I got this on Sunday. 'Guthrie arriving KC ex-Dacca Thursday. ETA ten hundred. Suggest uplook Geoffrey Carson at home Jeddu. Happy birthday. Hammaker.' (GUTHRIE takes the cable out of his hand.)
How's Dacca?
GUTHRIE. You know Dacca. It's not Paris.
WAGNER. (Nods; sings badly) 'April in Dacca... I love Dacca in the springtime. I love Dacca in the ..' Yeah. It's not Paris. It's Dacca,
GUTHRIE. (Handing back the cable) Is it your birthday?
WAGNER. No. Sounds good, doesn't it?
GUTHRIE. Did you clock the telex?
(WAGNER looks round and sees the teler.)
WAGNER. Christ!
GUTHRIE. (Nods) Happy birthday.
WAGNER. I don't believe it.
GUTHRIE. Do you think he's got a wire machine somewhere?
WAGNER. We're going to make them sick.
GUTHRIE. Who's out here?
WAGNER. Everybody. (Wagner has gone to the machine. He taps a
couple of keys and saics for the evidence that it is in worling
order. The machine chatters back at him briefly. WAGNER looks at GUTHRIE wide-eyed.) We are going to make them ill.
GUTHRIE. Doesn't the hotel have telex?
WAGNER. The hotel doesn't have cleft sticks. There's a post office in town which is a joke. Fritz Biedermeier said when he blew the dust off the counter there was an urgent message for Stanley from the New York Herald.
GUTHRIE. That wasn't here, was it?
WAGNER. It was a joke.
GUTHRIE. Okay. Who's Biedermeier?
WAGNER. Newsweek. He was in Beirut that time.
GUTHRIE. Oh yeah. Him. Has he got a photographer?
WAGNER. No, he's got a Pentax.
GUTHRIE. That's bad for trade.
WAGNER. Yeah, I wouldn't like it if you learned to write. I think we'll do okay. Especially now we've got wheels. Which is yours?
GUTHRIE. The Cortina.
WAGNER. Good. The taxi drivers have started to hire themselves
out by auction.
GUTHRIE. How did you get up from Kamba City, then?
WAGNER. In a Cessna.
GUTHRIE. Bloody firemen.
WAGNER. Afraid of missing the war. It wasn't so expensive-
shared with a couple of photographers.
GUTHRIE. (Interested) Yeah?-who's that?
WAGNER. One was a Frog-Jean-Paul something. Belmondo, maybe. St Laurent army fatigues and a gold chain, very tough with the Gauloises, no filters-know what I mean? 'I was a Left Bank layabout 'til I discovered photo-journalism.'
GUTHRIE. (Sharply, angrily) Knock it off will you, Dick? (Pause;
apologetically.) He's really very good.
WAGNER. Sorry.
GUTHRIE. What about the other one?
WAGNER. A groupie. No sweat. He had one of those cameras with a little picture of a cloud and a little picture of the sun and you slide it across according to the weather.
GUTHRIE. (Smiles) Well, I'm shooting Tri-X through two thousand quid's worth of lenses, but he'll get better pictures if he's in a better place. One time in Hué I was in a dug-out with Larry Barnes, and this American kid is there—he looked like a hippie, bummed his way into the country and got himself a letter from AP and a second-hand Leica, so he's accredited, right?—wouldn't know his arse from a hole in the ground except he's in a hole in the ground, and he's lost his light meter. He's reading his Kodak packet, and there's all kinds of shit coming over, mortars, and he says to Larry,
"Hey, do you think this is cloudy-bright or semi-dull?" Wel you can't see any sun because of the smoke, so Larry says,
'I think it's cloudy-bright.' This kid then starts walking forward behind a tank and the next time I see him he's gor a set of prints of VC attacking the bridge, it looked like Robert Mitchum was just out of frame. Three pages in Match.
WAGNER. Maybe it's the same kid.
GUTHRIE. Later he stepped on a land-mine.
WAGNER. (Pause) It probably isn't, then.
GUTHRIE. And Larry. And the other three in Larry's helicopter.
Do you know how many people were killed in that war?
WAGNER. Not exactly.
GUTHRIE. Fifty-four.
WAGNER. Oh. People.
GUTHRIE. And eighteen missing.
WAGNER. Don't be morbid, Gigi.
GUTHRIE. I'm not being morbid. (Pause) Before you came I was sleeping, just over there, and I dreamed that I bought it-got killed by a helicopter. I was really quite spooked.
WAGNER. You were dreaming about Larry.
GUTHRIE. No—not in a helicopter crash—we were in a jeep, and this gunship was shooting at us. And then it killed me. Is this going to be a helicopter war?
WAGNER. For Christ's sake!
GUTHRIE. Okay. How are they getting their stuff out?
WAGNER. Air freight from KC. There's nothing closer for pictures. Good chance of a pigeon, too-lots of people flying out at the moment. There's an overnight plane to London on Fridays-very handy; that gives you about twenty-four hours if you've got something for this week.
And there's the AP wire on Saturday if you're pushed— they'll print up for you.
GUTHRIE. Yeh. I checked them out on the way up. Either way, it's a four-hour drive for that lot.
WAGNER. You won't do any better.
GUTHRIE. Carson's got a helicopter.
(He sits down and picks up ALASTAIR's camera and opens it.
He's going to find a roll of film in his own bag and put it into ALASTAIR's camera. But this is something which he takes his time over, checking the camera itself, etc. Also, he gets interrupted so the job isn't completed until later.)
WAGNER. I can't take much more of this. Our own telex and a helicopter, and the competition on tom-toms. If this war starts on a Saturday morning you and I are going to be famous.
GUTHRIE. You're famous in Dacca. I saw your name in the
lavatory in the Inter-Continental.
WAGNER. How nice.
GUTHRIE. It said, 'Dick Wagner before he dicks you'.
WAGNER. (Grins) Sour grapes. That was a legitimate beat. I had my own source. By the time that Paki press officer handed it out with an embargo my story was in London-Jesus, it was on the stone.
GUTHRIE. All right.
WAGNER. (Getting worked up) I mean, I cracked that story, Gigi.
The embargo was just shutting the stable door—
GUTHRIE. Listen, it's nothing to me.
WAGNER. Yeh, but I know how those stuck-up bastards tell it around— the whole thing gets misreported.
GUTHRIE. (Mildly) And they're usually so accurate. Did you get
me a room?
WAGNER. You're with me. There's two hotels, both dumps.
Journalists hanging out the windows, and a Swedish TV crew sleeping in the lobby, and a lot of good friends from home too. We're going to make them ill. All we need is a story.
GUTHRIE. Do you think we're in the right place?
WAGNER. What do you mean?
GUTHRIE. I don't know what I mean.
WAGNER. Well, everybody else is here.
GUTHRIE. Yeh. I suppose so.
WAGNER. There's nothing better. Except an interview with the President, and nobody has even seen that mad bastard for six months. Everybody's had a go.
GUTHRIE. What's the story in Jeddu?
WAGNER. (Shrugs) It's as near as we can get to Alf.
GUTHRIE. Who's he?
WAGNER. Them. 'Who's he?' Don't you ever look at the bits between the photographs? Adoma Liberation Front. The Colonel. Colonel Shimbu.
GUTHRIE. I was just testing you.
WAGNER. Didn't you know about my famous scoop?
GUTHRIE. No.
WAGNER. Nor did I. Sunday, everyone gets cables. 'Globe finds
Colonel Shimbu. Why Colonel unfound by you', etcetera.
So everybody's screaming, where is he, Wagner, you bastard? Only, it isn't my story. I don't know where the bloody Colonel is. So they want to see my cable-they think it's a herogram from Hammaker. But of course I can't show it to them because I don't know what this happy birthday thing is all about. So then they're calling me a lying bastard, and following me to the lavatory when they aren't following armoured car patrols into the bush in broken-down taxis. You never saw anything like it.
GUTHRIE. Yes I did.
WAGNER. Yes you did. There's a government press officer here who's the usual lying jerk, but there's no way of telling whether he's lying because he knows the truth or because he doesn't know anything, so you can't trust his mendacity either—he could be telling the truth half the time, by accident. His line was that the Adoma Liberation Front didn't exist, and the army had got it completely surrounded.
Anyway, the BBC World Service picks up the Globe exclusive, and it turns out to be date-lined up-country with the rebels, interview with the Colonel himself, a party political broadcast wouldn't have done it better, and furthermore it's not a rebellion, it's a secession- get the picture?
Media credibility! Well, the press officer goes bananas. He wants to know which side the Globe thinks it's on. So I tell him, it's not on any side, stupid, it's an objective fact-gathering organization. And he says, yes, but is it objective-for or objective-against? (Pause) He may be stupid but he's not stupid.
GUTHRIE. I've got a present for you.
(GUTHRIE gets up and walks towards the back of the room where he picks up a pile of newspapers. WAGNER doesn't turn to see this.)
WAGNER. So he spends the briefing attacking the Globe-God bless him, it's the only story I've filed this week-and he's in a flat spin trying to make everything fit. At the end, this very smooth guy from Reuters says, 'Let me see if I've got this right. It's not a political movement, it's just a lot-or rather not a lot—of completely illiterate ivory poachers who've been reading too much Marxist propaganda, and they're all armed with home-made weapons flown by Cuban pilots.
GUTHRIE. (Coming back) Who's the Globe special correspondent?
WAGNER. I don't know. I'm famous in Jeddu. Scooped by my own paper. Bloody poaching, that's what it is. It's one of those ivory poachers moonlighting for Hammaker. I'd give anything for a copy of last Sunday's-(GUTHRIE dumps the newspapers into WAGNER's lap.) Aw, Gigi!
GUTHRIE. I couldn't get them all, just what they had when I
changed planes at Karachi. Second lead.
(The Sunday Globe is a respectable English paper. The African story is the second most important story on the front page. The back page is a sports page. The other papers are: the Sunday Express, the New York Times (Monday not Sunday), the Sunday Times, the Sunday Mirror, the Observer, the Sunday Telegraph and the News of the World.
WAGNER of course looks at the Globe first.)
WAGNER. 'A special correspondent'—
GUTHRIE. That's what I said.
WAGNER. What the hell does that mean? Fair old piece. (He turns the paper to look over the fold.) Took care of mine anyway-'Richard Wagner adds from Jeddu'—two
beat and no name on it.
paragraphs. (He puts the paper aside.) Well, well: A world
GUTHRIE. A freelance.
WAGNER. They have names. I don't get it.
GUTHRIE. (Picking up the Globe) Where is this place?
WAGNER. It's sort of North Wales.
GUTHRIE. What do you mean North Wales?
WAGNER. I've given up on place names here—they all sound like games you play on board ship. If a place isn't called Tombola it's called Housey-housey. The way to look at it is, KC is London, Jeddu is up the A4o-Cheltenham-and the Colonel is somewhere in the Welsh hills. (He has found the inside foreign page of the Sunday Express now.) 'The smouldering heart of this coffee-laden, copper-loaded corner of Africa is being ripped apart by the ambitions of a cashiered Colonel whose iron fist, UN observers fear, may turn out to be holding a hammer and sickle... (Scornfully) And a New York date-line, who needs it? (He tosses that aside and reads from the front page of the New York Times.)
'Jeddu, Saturday. This time last week Jeddu was a one-horse town on the road from Kamba City to nowhere.
Today you can't see the town for cavalry, mainly armoured personnel carriers and a few T-47 tanks. In them thar hills to the north-west, the renegade Colonel Shimbu is given no more chance than Colonel Custer—if only he'd stand still.
Unfortunately, no one can find the Colonel to tell him to stop playing the Indians and it may be that Jeddu is going to wake up one morning with its armoured cars drawn up in a circle. (He throws that aside.) I hate them and their Pulitzer Prizes. All writing and no facts. (The Sunday Times.) 'At five minutes past eight on Wednesday morning, an aide-de-camp on the staff of Supreme Commander and President Ginku Mageeba, his uniform distinguished by Christian Dior sunglasses and unbuttoned flies, drove a green and white jeep up to the Princess Alice Bar in downtown Jeddu and commandeered it as the nerve centre of Mageeba's victorious drive against the forces of darkness, otherwise known as the Adoma Liberation Front. The army itself appeared in time for elevenses, and by today the advance had nearly reached the Esso pump three hundred yards up the road towards the enemy. Very funny. All facts and no news. (He looks briefly through the Mirror.) Nothing.
Well, that's honest anyway. (The Observer.) 'Sources close to President Mageeba are conceding that the peasant army of the ALF has the tacit support of the indigenous population of the interior and is able to move unhindered through the Adoma hills.' (Considers this, nods sagely.) True.
(Sunday Telegraph.) 'Evidence is emerging that the civilian population of the Adoma region has been intimidated into supporting the Russian-equipped rural guerillas of the
ALF, but according to army sources, the self-styled Liberation Front is penned up in the Adoma hills.
(Considers this, nods sagely.) True. (News of the World-he only glances at the front page.) "Is this the laziest man in Britain?' I did that one once. Different bloke, mind you.
(WAGNER turns his attention back to the Globe, which GUTHRIE has put down. He looks at it glumly. The dog barks.
A car is arriving.)
GUTHRIE. Carson.
WAGNER. (Still preoccupied with the paper) I don't think it's anybody who's been around much. It's good stuff but it's too much I-was-there. It's somebody who wants to impress the world and doesn't know that the world isn't impressed by reporters and nobody is impressed by reporters except other reporters-who can work out that you were there without having it rammed down their throats.
(We have heard car doors.)
Yeah, I think I've got this one's number—he's not a star, he's a boy scout in an Austin Reed safari suit who someon
got lucky.
(MILNE appears at the edge of the room. WAGNER's description is not far off. WAGNER hasn't seen him.)
(Almost to himself) Little prick.
MILNE. I say ...
(GUTHRIE and WAGNER look at him.)
I say, that wouldn't be a Sunday Globe, would it?
(GUTHRIE and WAGNER look at each other.)
WAGNER. Care to have a look?
MILNE. Not last Sunday's?! I say-thanks...
WAGNER. Have you just come with Mr Carson?
MILNE. Yes, that's right. He's just gone up to see his wife.
(WAGNER gives him the Globe. MILNE ignores the front page and thumbs through to the foreign page inside. His disappointment is silent but immense. He tries another page.)
(Miserably; scanning the paper) He's just gone up to see his wife.
(WAGNER and GUTHRIE, especially WAGNER, watch him like people watching a play, tensely waiting for MILNE to find his story. MILNE gives up and closes the paper, giving the front page a casual glance. Then he sees his story and the jolt he gets is audible. WAGNER and GUTHRIE relax. MILNE reads for a few seconds, lost in himself.)
(To WAGNER) Do you need this paper?
WAGNER. No. I'd like you to have it.
MILNE. Thanks awfully. (Reading again.) Carson's just gone up
to see his wife and boy.
WAGNER. Yes, you said.
MILNE. Are you in mining as well?
WAGNER. As well as what?
(MILNE giggles and goes on reading.)
Anything interesting in the paper?
(MILNe finally puts the paper down.)
MILNE. Actually, I'm a journalist.
WAGNER. Oh.
MILNE. Actually, I'm on the Sunday Globe.
WAGNER. Ah.
MINE. Well, I'm not actually on the Sunday Globe.
WAGNER. What are you doing here, actually?
MILNE. I'm covering the rebellion. This is my interview with
Colonel Shimbu on the front page.
WAGNER. That's very good. How did you find him?
MILNE. A bit excitable but quite
WAGNER. (Hard edge) How did you find him?
MILNE. Oh. It was a bit of luck really. Some of his men stopped
a bus I was on.
WAGNER. What for? Food? Money?
MILNE. No. They give out leaflets and lecture the passengers for a while and let them carry on. But they took me off the bus.
I was the only white. That was a month ago before the story broke properly-I mean, the story was there all the time but no one was taking any notice of it, you just heard talk about it. I was in KC so I thought I'd have a recce, and I got kidnapped by this ALF group.
GUTHRIE. Lucky.
MILNE. Yes. I moved around with them for two weeks and finally I persuaded Shimbu he should let his case be properly reported. So he did the interview.
WAGNER. How did you get the story out?
MILNE. He got it out for me.
WAGNER. A pigeon?
MILNE. (Laughing patronizingly) A pigeon? No, we've got a little beyond that in Fleet Street. He gave it to one of his chaps to take over the border and he posted it for me.
(WAGNER glances at GUTHRIE.)
WAGNER. (Expressionless) Posted it.
MILNE. To tell you the truth the interview was ten days old but luckily I had Shimbu to myself. By the time the foreign press started to arrive in Kambawe the government got wise and attached the reporters to the army, which sounds promising but it takes away their freedom of movement. On a story like this it's no good at all until the real shooting starts. The story has got to be with the rebels. They shoul have known that.
(GUTHRIE smiles at WAGNER.)
WAGNER. Where was your last job?
MILNE. The Grimsby Evening Messenger.
WAGNER. The Grimsby Evening Messenger.
MILNE. That's an evening paper in Grimsby, in England. By the
way, my name is Jacob Milne.
WAGNER. What are you doing here, Jacob?
MILNE. In this house?
WAGNER. In Africa.
MILNE. Oh. I lost my job in Grimsby.
WAGNER. Yes?
MILNE. My idea was to get myself in on a good foreign story without too much competition. I thought, Eritrea.
WAGNER. This isn't Eritrea. Is it?
MILNE. No—no. Eritrea is up north.
WAGNER. I thought it was.
MILNE. I couldn't get in. Then I heard that there was this interesting situation developing in Kambawe.
WAGNER. Where did you hear that?
MILNE. In Grimsby. (WAGNER waits for more.) In Time Magazine
WAGNER. Ah.
MILNE. Incredible how it's worked out. Carson says there's fifty reporters in Jeddu. They've got themselves thoroughly lumbered. There's no story in Jeddu. (Reading from the Globe.)'... sources close to President Mageeba..? Sheer desperation... Richard Vahgner. I bet I've made him sicl Well, he's not going to be very pleased about my exclusive

WAGNER. Sit down, Jacob.
MILNE. Look, I'm sorry —(He turns to GUTHRIE.) are you
with—？
GUTHRIE. George Guthrie. Hello.
WILNE. Guthrie? —Christ. I thought your Lebanon pictures were just—
WAGNER. Sit down. I'm Dick Wagner. Where have you just
come from?
MILNE. The Kaminco Complex—you know-where the
Kaminco mines are—I can never get these places right— what's it called?—
GUTHRIE. Deck tennis.
MILNE. No.
SUTHRIE. Ping pong.
WAGNER. Shut up.
ILNE. Malakuangazi. About a hundred and fifty miles north.
SUTHRIE. What's Kaminco?
VAGNER. Kambawe Mining Corporation. Carson's outfit. (To
MILNE.) How did you get there?
MILNE. With the ALF of course. Shimbu captured it this
morning. That's my story. They shelled it and then went in and killed the garrison.
(WAGNER stares at him.)
WAGNER. Jesus wept.
(CARSON enters, heading for the study. WAGNER's interception is slightly ingratiating.)
Mr Carson-I'm Richard Wagner, Sunday Globe.
CARSON. Yes. Are you helping Jake on his story?
(WAGNER decides to swallow that.)
WAGNER. That's right. Fred Hammaker suggested I look you
up. Sends his regards. And to Mrs Carson.
CARSON. I'm afraid I've never heard of him. Excuse me.
(Leaving WAGNER looking at the closed study door.)
GUTHRIE. He's never heard of him.
WAGNER. I'm thinking about it. (To MILNE.) How did
Hammaker know about Carson?
MILNE. I told him.
GUTHRIE. When you sent your Colonel Shimbu piece.
MILNE. That's right. I thought Jeddu would be the next place I'a have a chance to file. I was right about that, though for the wrong reasons- like everybody else I thought the Colone was heading this way.
WAGNER. You haven't filed yet?
MILNE. I couldn't. The land cable was cut in the shelling. That's why I came out with Carson. Do you know what Carson has got here?
WAGNER. Seen it. Happy birthday.
MILNE. I knew Geoff Carson slightly. I met him in KC. He spends time in KC and Malakuangazi, it's a dog-leg with Jeddu at the bend, and he's also got a small potash operation just down the road from here-where the helicopter came down. Kaminco is mainly copper but there's some potash and also manganese-
WAGNER. Just get on with it.
MILNE. Well, I interviewed Carson for a background piece I sent Hammaker when I first arrived in the country. He didn't use it. Sent me a cable, saying 'Think stuff unwanted.'
WAGNER. Too right.
MILNE. It paid off anyway. Carson wanted to check his quotes so he gave me his home telex number. I had it in my book. I told Hammaker it was one place he might be able to reach me.
WAGNER. And here you are.
MILNE. With bells on.
(He takes his 'copy' from his pocket and flourishes it.
WAGNER takes it from him.)
WAGNER. Well, you're a bloody idiot. You should have stayed inside and got Carson to carry your story out. He was the pigeon of a lifetime, with his own little helicopter. Now how are you going to get back in?
MILNE. Carson said he'd lend me a Kaminco car.
WAGNER. Don't be a clown—no one's going to get into
Malakuangazi now without a tank.
GUTHRIE. Why did Shimbu let Carson leave?
MILNE. I don't know. (Pause apologetically.) I thought you meant a real pigeon... before. Sorry.
VAGNER. (To GUTHRIE) What do you think?
UTHRIE. (To MILNE) Carson's using you for something.
LILNE. Does it matter?
UTHRIE. Maybe not. I'll come with you.
AILNE. Fine. I never thought I'd be on a story with you.
PUTHRIE. Me neither.
(GUTHRIE relaxes, having settled his immediate future. He picks up ALASTAIR's camera and completes the business of inserting a film.)
MILNE. How interesting—I always imagined you'd have one of those flashy Japanese jobs with lenses and things...
SUTHRIE. (Smiles) There you go.
WAGNER. (With MILNE's story) Is all this going to stand up?
Twelve Mig-17s, three Ilyushin-28s—who told you?
MILNE. I watched them land this morning.
WAGNER. Where did they come from?
MILNE. Yemen. But Shimbu already had the American T-28s stashed away on strip which the Russians put down for him in the desert. He's got three of those. Flown in by Kambawe Airforce deserters.
WAGNER. (To GUTHRIE) True to form. No matter how far left you plant your flag, there's always a few who'll go with you.
MILNE. Actually, no—this was tribal, not political. This was very early on and no more have come over since, which probably means the Airforce have grounded anyone they're not sure of. That's probably worth checking into.
WAGNER. (Drily) Thank you.
MILNE. You can see why Shimbu went for Malakuangazi-I should have worked it out. It's not the mine, it's the airstrip.
There's no strip at Jeddu for anything bigger than a light plane. In the hills he had to make do with Mi-8 choppers to supply him from across the border.
WAGNER. Who flies them?
MILNE. Cubans. It's in there.
WAGNER. Did you actually see a Cuban flying a helicopter?
MILNE. Not exactly —
WAGNER. (Flaring up) Listen, Jacob—I know what it's like in Grimbsy. You can say that Cubans have taken over the fishing fleet and next day you say that they haven't, actually, and nobody gives a bugger, because it's Grimsby.
But this is the Sunday Globe and if you say Shimbu's got Cuban pilots you've got to have something better than his word and a Havana cigar—so who says they're Cuban?
MILNE. They do.
WAGNER. (Pause) You interviewed them?
MILNE. Not exactly interviewed-they wouldn't let me. We played cards a few times. I was just improving my Spanish.
(His irritation gets the better of him.) And if you don't mind my saying so, Mr Wagner, you know fuck all about the Grimsby Evening Messenger, which is a great deal more important around Grimbsy than the Sunday Globe is around the globe on any bloody day of the week!
WAGNER. Please call me Dick. This guy with the field battery—
did you talk to him?
(WAGNER is referring to MILNE's pages.)
MILNE. Yes.
WAGNER. He spoke English?
MILNE. No, but I know a little Russian—it was my optional
language at school.
WAGNER. (Exasperated) Tell me something, Jacob-what did you
get fired for?
MILNE. I didn't exactly get fired. It was after the trouble in the
provinces-you know, the strike.
WAGNER. Strike?
MILNE. The provincial reporters' strike. There were several reports in the Globe, including one from Grimsby which was not as accurate as one might have wished.
WAGNER. I don't understand. You got fired for going on strike?
MILNE. (Laughs) Are you serious?
WAGNER. (Pause) Oh no.
MILNE. Yes. It all seems a bit silly out here, doesn't it?
WAGNER. Milne. You're one of those blokes all the fuss was
about in ...
MILNE. Grimsby.
WAGNER. (To GUTHRIE) Do you see who we've got here? It is the
Grimsby scab.
MILNE. I say, that's not very nice.
WAGNER. Is it not?
MILNE. No. I don't keep an abusive vocabulary ready for anyone who acts on different principles.
WAGNER. Oh, acting on principle were you?
MILNE. Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
WAGNER. Is it your principle to betray your fellow workers when they're in confrontation with management?
(MILNE can't believe this. He almost laughs.)
MILNE. Come again?
WAGNER. (Furious) Don't patronize me, you little berk.
MILNE. I'm sorry-I was just taken aback. I never got used to the way the house Trots fell into the jargon back in Grimsby-I mean, on any other subject, like the death of the novel, or the sex life of the editor's secretary, they spoke ordinary English, but as soon as they started trying to get me to join the strike it was as if their brains had been taken out and replaced by one of those little golf-ball things you get in electric typewriters... 'Betrayal' ...
'Confrontation' ... 'Management'... My God, you'd need a more supple language than that to describe an argument between two amoebas.
(But WAGNER has already turned away to GUTHRIE well worked up.)
WAGNER. 'Special Correspondent'! That's why Hammaker didn't give him a by-line! He knew Derek would never have worn it for a minute—
SUTHRIE. What Derek?
WAGNER. Battersby-Derek Battersby-Branch Secretary.
SUTHRIE. Battersby? I went on something with him once ...
bloody useless reporter.
WAGNER. He's bloody good at squeezing the management. The don't always go together.
GUTHRIE. Do they ever go together?
MILNE. I thought foreign correspondents would find the whole
thing a bit parochial.
WAGNER. (Acidly) I am not a foreign correspondent. A foreign correspondent is someone who lives in foreign parts and corresponds, usually in the form of essays containing no new facts. Otherwise he's someone who flies around from hotel to hotel and thinks the most interesting thing about any story is the fact that he has arrived to cover it. I am a fireman. I go to fires. Brighton or Kambawe-they're both out-of-town stories and I cover them the same way. I don' file prose. I file facts. So don't imagine for a moment you' stumbled across a fellow member of the Travellers' Club.
To me you're the Grimsby scab. Jacob Milne. Yeah. What happened to the others?
MILNE. What do you mean?
WAGNER. It wasn't just you, was it? Getting out the paper like
bob-a-job week?
MILNE. No.
WAGNER. Well I hope they're all making out as stringers up the
Limpopo.
MILNE. They're all still on the Messenger. After the strike was settled the union expelled us, but the others appealed and got fined. Of course, the union didn't really want to expel me, they expected me to appeal too.
WAGNER. Why didn't you?
MILNE. I was feeling a bit wicked. The Messenger isn't officially a closed shop, you see—they'd just got used to having a hundred per cent membership. I gave them a problem.
WAGNER. Smarty-boots.
MILNE. I'm afraid so. But it backfired. By a majority decision they refused to work with me, and it looked as if the paper was going to shut down again, this time because of me.
WAGNER. So the management dumped you. You had to learn the hard way, didn't you? Bosses are bosses, and that's what it's all about, kid.
MILNE. I resigned.
VAGNER. Oh yeah.
MILNE. They refused to sack me.
WAGNER. They just heaved a huge sigh of relief when you went.
MILNE. Possibly.
WAGNER. Well, I hope the experience radicalized you a little.
We're working to keep richer men than us richer than us, and nothing's going to change that without worker solidarity.
MILNE. I bet they don't come much more solid than you.
VAGNER. (Wide-eyed to GUTHRIE) Did you hear what he just said
to me?
WILNE. The Globe is losing a million a year, and nobody's getting rich on the Messenger either. It's not a private coal-mine sending somebody's son to Eton, it's a limited liability company publishing a reasonably honest and not particularly wonderful local paper in the last two-paper town of its size in the country that began the whole idea of the right to publish, and you'd close it down out of pique
WAGNER. What are you burbling about?
MILNE. We were called out for the same reason as the Mirror last
year—because the printers had got a new deal.
WAGNER. (High) Well, there were printers getting more than
journalists!
MILNE. Yes, I know, but you make it sound as if the natural order has been overthrown. Fish sing in the streets, rivers run uphill, and the printers are getting more than the journalists. Okay—you're worth more than a printer. But look at some of this-
(With his hand, or perhaps his foot, MILNE spreads the newspapers and the News of the World lies in front of him.)
'Exposed! The Ouija Board Widow Who's Writing Hitler's Memoirs’... 'It Was Frying Tonight And Every Night In The Back Of The Chip Shop!'... (and the Mirror) 'Some Like It Hot And Sweet-Sally Smith is a tea lady in a Blackpool engineering works, but it was the way she filled those C-cups which got our cameaman al stirred p" fer crap. And it's written by grown men earning maybe ten thousand a year. If I was a printer, I'a look at some of the stuff I'm given to print, and I'd ask myself what is suppose be so special about the people who write it- is that radical enough for you-Dick?
(The feeling is that WAGNER might actually hit him. Before ve can find out whether he would have done or not, the study don opens and CARSON comes out, head bent over a sheet of telex paper in his hands. He comes out reading.)
CARSON. 'Onpass Milne. Congratulations Shimbu interview
worldwide interest. Hammaker.
(He hands this to MILNE.)
MILNE. Oh. .. thanks.
CARSON. Sorry I had to leave you so long.
(CARSON nods at GUTHRIE.)
GUTHRIE. George Guthrie.
CARSON. George. (They shake hands.) ... and ...
WAGNER. Dick Wagner.
CARSON. Good. Geoff is my name. Should we have a beer? Or
would you prefer something stronger?
GUTHRIE. Beer is fine.
CARSON. Dick?
WAGNER. Thank you.
CARSON. Sure you wouldn't rather have a scotch?
WAGNER. Much rather. Thanks.
(CARSON looks again at GUTHRIE.)
GUTHRIE. No—beer is fine.
CARSON. Jake?
(MILNE seems to be still reading the telex.)
MILNE. Yes?
CARSON. Beer or scotch?
MILNE. Yes-fine.
CARSON. (Giving up) I'll go and tell Francis. (Io Milne.) You car try London now if you like.
AGNER. We're very grateful to you... Geoff... most grateful.
ARSON. (To MILNE) By the way you've got the spare room.
ILNE. Thank you.
(CARSON leaves.)
AGNER. I want to use that thing.
LILNE. How do you get London anyway?
AGNER. You may be wasting your time.
ILNE. Why?
UTHRIE. You're kidding.
VAGNER. No, I'm an officer of the Globe chapel.
UTHRIE. That doesn't make it your responsibility.
VAGNER. That's right. Let Hammaker fight it out with Battersby
at branch level.
AILNE. What is this?
VAGNER. (By way of answer) 'Onpass Battersby. Must protest employment of special correspondent Milne, non-member ex-Grimsby? All right?
MILNE. (Pause) We went in under heavy sniper fire. If there'd been a paid-up member around he could have had the job with pleasure.
WAGNER. Nothing personal. Send the piece. I'm not stopping
you.
MILNE. Thanks a lot.
GUTHRIE. You are kidding.
WAGNER. Watch me. (He goes to the study door and then invites
MILNE.) Watch me?
(MILNE goes into the study with WAGNER, who shuts the door.
GUTHRIE takes a camera out of the camera bag and hangs it round his neck. CARSON returns.)
CARSON. Ruth's just coming down.
GUTHRIE. Okay if I take a picture?
CARSON. What for?
GUTHRIE. I don't know. Can I?
CARSON. I suppose there's no harm.
(GUTHRIE gets ready to take pictures, and is taking them over the next few moments until RUTH's entrance.)
GUTHRIE. How can you get back into that place?
CARSON. Malakuangazi? There's no way you can get me back.
was lucky to get out.
GUTHRIE. I mean ...
CARSON. Oh... How can you ...
GUTHRIE. Me and Jake.
CARSON. Jake asked me to help him.
GUTHRIE. Can you?
CARSON. Mageeba will have got his armour up there. You can't
just stroll through.
GUTHRIE. What then?
CARSON. We'll see.
GUTHRIE. Do you know Shimbu?
CARSON. Yes.
GUTHRIE. Why did he let you out? (Pause) I wondered if you were some kind of ... I don't mean messenger—
CARSON. Emissary.
GUTHRIE. Yes.
(CARSON doesn't reply. GUTHRIE takes pictures. The telephone rings. GUTHRIE had just finished but this gives him a different sort of picture to take and he takes some while CARSON is on the phone. CARSON does hardly any talking, much more listening.
What he says isn't audible anyway.
Behind CARSON, on phone, and GUTHRIE, WAGNER comes out of the study, closing the door behind him just as RUTH enters from within the house. When they see each other they pause, looking at each other. WAGNER smiles.
CARSON hangs up and turns and sees them. FRANCIS enters with a tray of drinks, beers and scotches.)
CARSON. Ah, darling-have you met?
RUTH. No, we haven't. Mr Guthrie told me you were expected..
(Offering her hand.) Mr ... Strauss ... ? (She takes a scotch off the tray.) Thank you, Francis. (Her manner is amused, relaxed.)
WAGNER. Wagner.
UTH. Wagner. Exactly. I knew it was Richard.
VAGNER. How nice to meet you, Mrs Carson.
(FRANCIs is moving around and the drinks are being taken off his tray. RUTH and WAGNER move down through the room and end up down-stage.)
ARSON. We're Geoff and Ruth to everyone around here. (He takes a beer off the tray.) Isn't that right, Francis?
RANCIS. Yes sir, Mr Carson.
WAGNER. (Taking a scotch off the tray) Ruth, then.
RUTH. And I'll call you Richard.
WAGNER. Most people call me Dick.
RUTH. I'm not terribly fond of Dick.
WAGNER. You could have fooled me.
(Their position in the room has enabled him to say this evenly.)
RUTH. Well, that's that settled. Why don't we sit down?
GUTHRIE. (To FRANCIS but for RUTH's benefit; taking his beer off the
tray) Thank you, sir...
RUTH. Where's the other chap? The one who came with you?
CARSON. Jacob Milne.
WAGNER. He's in there trying to raise London. Do you know
London, Ruth?
RUTH. Oh, rather. Good old London eh? ... the red buses scattering the pigeons in Trafalgar Square...
CARSON. Yes, indeed.
/ RUTH. Covent Garden porters with baskets of fruit and veg piled on their heads, threading their way among the flower girls and professors of linguistics.
CARSON. All gone now.
RUTH. Flexing their native wit against the inimitable banter of the pearly kings... The good old London bobby keeping a fatherly eye on the children feeding the beefeaters outside
Buckingham Palace ...
CARSON. Oh, all right.
RUTH... giving himself a glancing blow with his riot shield
every time a tourist asks him the time.
(She turns her wrist to look at her watch and staggers back from an imaginary blow to the forehead.)
CARSON. Don't be a rotter. (To WAGNER.) How is London elp
CORE. Don't ask him he's a bloody colonial, knows noting, (Deep pause. RUTH is amused. CARSON is forgiving. GUTHRI apologetic. WAGNER helps out.)
WAGNER. It's quite true about me. When I first arrived in London I thought Fleet Street was between the Strand and Trafalgar Square. I was working from a Monopoly board,
RUTH. We play Monopoly with Alastair.
CARSON. Do we?
RUTH. On Boxing Day. As far as I remember Fleet Street was yellow and rather cheap. Is that right, Dick?
WAGNER. Not necessarily. Leicester Square and Coventry Street were yellow. To be fair you'd never confuse Fleet Street with Soho on the ground, you never saw anything so sleazy
—the whole place has given itself over to crude titillation and eye-catching junk.
RUTH. And how about Soho?
WAGNER. (Catching up) Soho. You're a caution.
RUTH. Where are you from, George?
GUTHRIE. London Wall. In the City. Of course, it's all been
knocked down now. Bloody shame.
CARSON. Yes, indeed.
GUTHRIE. You should see it now. Do you know St Paul's?
RUTH. I've heard of it.
GUTHRIE. Sitting there surrounded by giant boxes. It looks like it's just been unpacked and nobody's cleared up.
CARSON. Actually, Ruth was born in London.
GUTHRIE. Really? Well, you wouldn't know it now. When were
you last there?
RUTH. Friday.
GUTHRIE. (Pause) I think I'll just sit and drink my beer.
CARSON (To RUTH) You're a rotter.
(The telephone rings and he gets up to answer it. Again he does more listening than talking.)
RUTH. I'm a rotter, George. I'm a frightful rotter. I was picking ​​up Allie from prep school, his first term at Ascot Heath.
(ALASTAIR comes in wearing pyjamas and dressing gown and slippers.)
Hello, darling, your mummy's a rotter. Have you come to say goodnight?
ALASTAIR. (Outraged) Goodnight? I haven't even had supper.
RUTH. Well, go and see Winnie, she'll have it ready.
ALASTAIR. I want to talk to Mr Guthrie.
RUTH. Mr Guthrie will come and see you, won't you, George?
GUTHRIE. Never fear.
(He stands and moves to the verandah and looks out, and yawns.)
ALASTAIR. Will you come and see me in my room?
GUTHRIE. Promise.
RUTH. So will I. Say goodnight to Mr Wagner.
ALASTAIR. Goodnight.
WAGNER. Goodnight, Alastair.
ALASTAIR. You won't forget, George?
RUTH. Mr Guthrie to you-hop it.
(ALASTAIR goes. GUTHRIE sits in a comfortable chair on the verandah.)
Oh dear, he's taken rather a fancy to George. Next thing, he'll want to be a journalist when he grows up. What is a mother to do?
(CARSON hangs up the phone.)
Should I tell him it'll send him blind, and risk
psychological damage, or should I sew a war correspondent's badge on his pyjamas and hope he grows out of it?
CARSON. (Leaving the room) Darling, these gentlemen may not be
used to your sense of humour. (Calling) Allie!
RUTH. Well I'm going to need a sense of humour if Alastair's going to go around the house putting his foot in the doors and asking impertinent questions. Perhaps I'll get him a reporter doll for Christmas. Wind it up and it gets it wrong.
(She seems in high good humour.) What does it say when you press its stomach? Come on, Dick!
WAGNER. I name the guilty man.
RUTH. (Laughs) Very good.
(CARSON comes back and takes his place. RUTH gets up to replenish her glass.)
Yes, that's a question which has loomed large in my life-who's the guilty man? Until Geoffrey of course. Geoffrey is entirely blameless.
CARSON. Steady on, Ruth.
WAGNER. Who is the guilty man this time, Geoff?
RUTH. Don't get cheeky, Wagner.
WAGNER. Shimbu or Mageeba?
CARSON. Oh...
RUTH. Jesus!
CARSON. Depends which paper you read, doesn't it?
RUTH. Don't do that to me.
(RUTH takes her drink and sits apart from the men.)
WAGNER. What did the President have to say?
CARSON. Are you interviewing me, Dick?
WAGNER. Is that all right?
CARSON. No, it isn't.
WAGNER. Off the record, then.
RUTH. Tell him to bugger off.
WAGNER. No attribution.
RUTH. I'll tell him. Elizabeth Taylor in Elephant Walk ...
(Shouts) 'Get out of this house! This is no longer Geoffrey Carson's bachelor quarters, I'm his beautiful bride from England, and I'm sick of all you hooligans playing bicycle polo in my sitting-room!'
(CARSON realizes that GUTHRIE has fallen asleep holding his beer glass. CARSON goes over and gently takes the glass out of GUTHRIE's hands.)
CARSON. George tells me he'd like to get into Malakuangazi.
WAGNER. We both would.
CARSON. What about Jake?
WAGNER. Jake is a freelance. I'm the Globe's man on this story.
RUTH. He's got hair in his nostrils. I must have been drunk.
CARSON. He did well.
RUTH. I was drunk.
WAGNER. Yes, he did well. He had some luck.
CARSON. Was that it?
RUTH. I name the guilty men—J and B.
WAGNER. Okay, but now it's up to me to go where I can get ahead of the competition. There'll be a lot of journalists with the same idea.
CARSON. They haven't got a hope. The army won't let them
through.
WAGNER. Can you help?
CARSON. Yes. I can give you a car, a driver who speaks the lingo, and a pass signed by the President.
WAGNER. My God, what am I doing for you?
RUTH. Don't ask.
CARSON. Colonel Shimbu didn't let me go for old times' sake. I was taking a message. You'll be taking the reply.
WAGNER. A reply from the President?
CARSON. Use your imagination.
WAGNER. Unprofessional. What I use has to check out.
CARSON. Well, I'm flying down to KC. I'll be back in the morning, early, with a letter and the pass.
WAGNER. Signed by Mageeba.
CARSON. That's it.
WAGNER. And the letter too? (Pause) Just say yes-what's the
matter?
CARSON. It's called giving you as much information as you need
to know.
RUTH. Terrible title. (Sings, improvising.) 'Giving you as much
information…’
(RUTH' worries away at this song, at intervals, until RUTH speaks out loud.)
WAGNER. Has Shimbu offered a deal?
CARSON. Come on, Dick. Well, you can assume I wouldn't ask you if I thought there'd be a war going on.
WAGNER. Why a journalist?
CARSON. Who else wants to go? I was thinking of Jake.
WAGNER. No. How long is the drive?
CARSON. About five hours. Lunch in Malakuangazi.
WAGNER. Friday lunch. Twenty-four hours to get back here and file. That's nice going if the Colonel cooperates.
CARSON. It might be better if Jake went. Shimbu likes him.
WAGNER. Shimbu will like me. I'm very popular.
RUTH. I've always wanted to meet a popular journalist. I mean socially, I don't mean under one's bed or outside the law courts. One is not normally introduced to journalists. I mention that as a matter of circumstance, not as a piece of social etiquette. Though, of course, it is that, too.
CARSON. I thought you were being unnaturally silent.
WAGNER. You don't much care for the media, do you, Ruth?
RUTH. The media. It sounds like a convention of spiritualists.
CARSON. Ruth has mixed feelings about reporters.
RUTH. No, I haven't. I despise them. Not foreign correspondents, of course-or the gardening notes. The ones in between.
I'm sure you know what I mean.
WAGNER. You've met one or two, have you?
RUTH. Under the bed, outside the law courts... But don't imagine that I despise them because of any injury done to me—on the contrary I looked jolly nice in my divorce hat, and being on the front page of four morning newspapers did my reputation nothing but good in my part of Highgate—
'Hasn't she done well?' And even the indignities with which the whole saga began... well, there are worse things than being pursued across Shropshire by the slavering minions of a philistine press lord; in fact, it brought Geoffrey and me closer together. I loved him for the way he out-drove them in his Jaguar, and it wasn't his fault at all that the early morning tea in our hideaway hotel was brought in by a Fleet Street harpie in a tweeny... no, no, it isn't that. It isn't even—or anyway not entirely-the way it was written up, or rather snapped together in that Lego-set language they have, so that poor Geoffrey's wife, a notably hardboiled zoologist who happens to breed rare parakeets, and who incautiously admitted to a reporter that, yes she would like Geoff to give me up, and yes, she would have him back, was instantly dubbed Heartbreak Parrot Woman In Plea for Earl's Brother. Earl's brother. That's the bit. Of all the husbands who ran off with somebody's wife that week, Geoffrey qualified because he had a measly title and if the right three-hundred people went down on the Royal Yacht he'd be Duke of Bognor. Has anyone ever bothered to find out whether anybody really cares? The populace and the popular press. What a grubby symbiosis it is. Which came first?
The rhinoceros or the rhinoceros bird?
(The study door opens.)
MILNE. Dick! I got a line!
(The study door closes. WAGNER gets up to go.)
WAGNER. Titled people haven't had the greatest luck with
journalists. Infatuation gave way to resentment without any intervening period of indifference. I remember you now.
Just. The beginning of the Red Guard phase. Nick Webster was allowed thirty thousand pounds a year for tip-off money. Thought he was the scourge of privilege. Thought the paper was behind him. Don't you love it? If someone had convinced the paper that the AB readership has gone over to astronomy, Nick would have found himself on the roof with a telescope.
(WAGNER goes out into the study closing the door behind him.)
CARSON. You're riding him a little hard, aren't you? Is anything
the matter?
(CARSON goes to the telephone and is using it during this scene.)
RUTH. Geoffrey, there's something I have to tell you.
CARSON. Mm? (Into phone.) Carson. Yes.
RUTH. Darling, there's something I have to tell you.
CARSON. What's up?
RUTH. My darling, there's something I have to tell you that
happened when I was in London.
CARSON. (Turning to her from the telephone) Ruth?
RUTH. Geofiey, darling, when I was in London I did something rather silly ...
CARSON. Eh, Ruth?
'RUTH. (American) We're two grown up people, Geoffrey, le's
try to be mature about this.
(CARSON temporarily free from the phone but still holding on.)
CARSON. Aren't you talking to me?
(RUTH turns towards him for the first time.)
RUTH. I'm sorry I'm a rotten wife.
CARSON. You're not a rotten wife. I've had one of those.
RUTH. Geoff—
(CARSON is caught by the phone.)
CARSON. I'm sorry. (Into phone.) Yes? ... yes.
(CARSON is occupied on the phone now. RUTH lights a cigarette
—she smokes long cigarettes and usually stubs them out after a few puffs.)
RUTH. (Loudly) I have brought shame on the house of Carson!
Yes! It's Dick! He took advantage of me, Geoffrey! I fought it, my God how I fought it! But I couldn't help myself!
(CARSON listening at the phone, half turns with his free hand stretched out towards her, his fingers ready to receive a lit cigarette.)
Don't shoot, Geoffrey!
(Distant echo of gun-shot.
She puts her cigarette between his fingers.)
(Casually) By the way, Geoffrey, I let Wagner take me to bed in London, in the Royal Garden Hotel, view over Kensington High Street, chosen for its proximity to the Embassy, in the visa section of which I met him while he was fixing his papers. I was fixing Alastair's. 'Going out to Kambawe?' 'Actually, I live there.' 'How interesting. I'm going out for the Sunday Globe. I say, you couldn't spare the time for a chat, could you?-spot of lunch-dinner— drinks-nightcap-and so on.' And so on. I believe it's called de-briefing. Not half bad either, though not as good as he thinks. Next day I picked up Allie and flew home.
(CARSON hangs up the phone.)
CARSON. It's on.
(His back is to RUTH. He is looking at a document, taken from his pocket; not absorbed in it, perhaps talking to RUTH though we can't see his face.)
RUTH I didn't blame Wagner at all, 'til he showed up here looking for a second helping. I thought I let him off lightly.
That man is not a gentleman. Thinks I hop into bed with strange men because I hopped into bed with a strange man.
(Pause) I'm sorry.
CARSON. Are you listening, Ruth?
RUTH. I'm sorry—
CARSON. I've told Allie to get dressed.
RUTH. What?
CARSON. He can stay with the Krebs for a couple of days. I
don't want him here.
RUTH. Is it on, then?
CARSON. Looks like it. You really ought to go, too. I trust Mageeba less than I trust Shimbu, and I don't trust Shimbu.
RUTH. Do you want me to go with Allie?
CARSON. No. I don't.
(RUTH kisses him. Nothing too special.)
RUTH. Then I'll stay.
(WAGNER, re-entering from the study, almost catches this.)
WAGNER. Sorry.
CARSON. All right.
(WAGNER would have retired, but now closes the study door and comes forward.)
I'll go and see how Allie's getting on.
(CARSON goes.)
WAGNER. Is it safe to come in?
RUTH. Why not?
(RUTH goes to the drinks shelf, and pours the remainder of a bottle of I and B into a glass for herself. It makes a large double scotch.)
WAGNER. I thought I detected feelings of bitterness and bad
RUTH. Whatever gave you that idea? I name this ship Titanic (She smashes the neck of the empty bottle on the marble shalf)
-long may she sail.
(RUTH drops the rest of the bottle into the bin at her feet. She picks up her glass and turns to Wagner.)
WAGNER. You seemed to find me agreeable enough in London.
RUTH. And you thought I might find you just as agreeable in Jeddu, eh? That's something I forgive. It's crass but I forgive it. And just in case finding-you-agreeable-enough is supposed to be Australian understatement for wetting myself down to my socks, let me tell you something, Wagner—if I had fancied you at all when you chatted me up in the visa office, I would have run a mile. That's what we honourable ladies with decent husbands do-didn't you know that? Every now and again we meet a man who attracts us, and we run a mile. I let you take me to dinner because there was no danger of going to bed with you. And then because there was no danger of going to bed with you a second time, I went to bed with you. A lady, if surprised by melancholy, might go to bed with a chap, once; or a thousand times if consumed by passion. But twice, Wagner, twice... a lady might think she'd been taken for a tart.
(WAGNER takes his cable out of his pocket and gives it to RUTH.)
WAGNER. This is a cable I got on Sunday, from my editor. I didn't come here to sniff at your skirts. (While RUTH is reading the cable.) Believe it or not, I like to read. I like modern fiction and historical biography best. One of the things that makes novels less plausible than history, I find, is the way they shrink from coincidence. (He waits until RUTH looks up.) And also the way that so few women in fiction are in love with their husbands.
RUTH. I'm not in love with anybody. I just like some people a great deal more than 1 like others, and I like Geoffrey a great deal more than I like you. Is that all right?
WAGNER. Yes, that's fine.
RUTH. Good. (She gives him back the cable.) Happy Birthday.
(ALASTAIR comes in dressed to travel.)
Come to give me a kiss, Allie?
ALASTAIR. No—I want my camera.
RUTH. Be quick then.
(RUTH goes out. ALASTAIR goes to where GUTHRIE is sleeping.
He kneels down and whispers to him.)
ALASTAIR. Mr Guthrie...
WAGNER. Don't wake him. I'll find your camera.
ALASTAIR. He said he'd show me how it works.
WAGNER. He put a film in for you. (He finds the camera where
GUTHRIE had been sitting.) Here you are.
ALASTAIR. Oh . . . gosh, thanks. It's my dad's old camera really.
WAGNER. I say, I thought you were going to bed.
ALASTAIR. Daddy's taking me to Kamba City.
WAGNER. Why's that?
ALASTAIR. I'm going to stay with Krebs. Do you know him?
WAGNER. No.
ALASTAIR. He lives in KC. He's my friend.
WAGNER. Oh.
ALASTAIR. I bet you don't know who my dad is going to see. I'll
give you a hundred guesses.
WAGNER. The President.
ALASTAIR. He told you.
WAGNER. Do you know the President?
ALASTAIR. No, I'm too young. That's why daddy's sending me to KC. He doesn't want me here when the President comes.
WAGNER. (Pause) Well, you'll meet the President another time, I
expect. When is he coming here?
ALASTAIR. Tomorrow night, probably. Don't tell daddy I know it's him—he just said it was somebody coming.
WAGNER. And who told you, then?
ALASTAIR. My mum.
(Off-stage CARSON calls ' Allie!')
WAGNER. Don't worry, I won't tell him.
(CARSON enters.)
(With camera) You have to guess how far it is-this, you see-three feet six feet and that's infinity, which means as far as you can see.
-you turn
CARSON. Come on, Allie, into the car. (To WAGNER, as Allie goes.)
Allie was going to visit a pal in KC-so I'm taking him
now-
WAGNER. I see.
CARSON. Might as well. Two birds with one stone.
WAGNER. What a childhood, eh?
CARSON. Yes. He's quite used to helicopters.
WAGNER. Yes, he was saying. Well, I hope everything goes well
for you.
CARSON. See you in the morning.
WAGNER. Thanks, Geoff.
(CARSON goes out. WAGNER stands still, thinking, and listens to the sounds of farewell, the car doors slamming, the car leaving.
WAGNER is tense, and then he gives an inarticulate cry of triumph and punches his fist through the air like a goal-scorer.
He moves quickly to GUTHRIE and slaps his hands together by GUTHRIE's ear, calls his name, and wakes him unceremoniously.
GUTHRIE comes awake, and stands up in the same moment, talking.)
GUTHRIE. I'm fine-I'm fine-where are we going?
(WAGNER is as high as a kite.)
WAGNER. I'm going back to the hotel. Need the car. (GUTHRIE relapses into the chair.) Keys! (WAGNER goes to the study door and opens it.) How are you doing? (He comes back and leaves the door ajar. The telex audible. To GUTHRIE.) Listen, you're going to Malakuangazi, you and Jake, in the morning.
GUTHRIE. I should bloody think so.
WAGNER. I've got you a car, a driver and a pass, and I've arranged a cease-fire. The Globe never sleeps.
GUTHRIE. (Bitterly) I know.
WAGNER. I'll cover this end.
(RUTH returns to the room.)
RUTH. George- poor George— when did you last sleep in a bed?
GUTHRIE. I was just pretending to be asleep. It's an old photographer's trick.
RUTH. Oh yes, I'm sure.
GUTHRIE. I promised to go and see Alastair—
RUTH. Oh dear— you've missed him-
GUTHRIE. Missed him?
WAGNER. I gave him the camera. You'll see him next time. (To RUTH.) I'm taking George to the hotel.
RUTH. There's room in the dorm. Geoffrey arranged it.
WAGNER. Well, that would be better. It's going to be quite an
early start.
GUTHRIE. Yes, thanks. I'll get my stuff out of the car.
(GUTHRIE goes out.)
RUTH. I hope you don't mind sharing a room?
WAGNER. You're a sport, Mrs Carson, but let's just be friends.
RUTH. Bastard.
WAGNER. I made an excuse and left.
(WAGNER is leaving but MILNE comes out of the study holding a piece of telex. MILNE doesn't see RUTH.)
MILNE. Dick, I've got your reply—
WAGNER. What?
MILNE. (Slightly embarrassed) The reply to your, um, protest…
WAGNER. Oh yes? From Battersby?
MILNE. No.
WAGNER. Well, what does it say?
MILNE. 'Onpass Wagner. Upstick protest arsewards.
Hammaker.'
WAGNER. This is Jacob Milne. He'll be making the trip with
George.
MILNE. Oh-how do you do?
RUTH. How do you do?
WAGNER. You're staying the night here, Jake, leaving early
tomorrow. Geoffrey will fill you in.
MILNE. Fine.
WAGNER. he any incity or put thr at but
copy or bring his film out.
MILNE. Okay. Don't worry. What will you do?
WAGNER. Best I can. (To RUTH.) Thanks for everything. (To
MILNE.) See you.
MILNE. No hard feelings?
WAGNER. It was your story anyway. (He's going but a thought strikes him.) Why did you choose the Globe?
MILNE. Well, Hammaker started on the Messenger. Didn't you
know that?
WAGNER. No, I didn't.
MILNE. Yes. He's famous in Grimsby.
WAGNER. (Smiles) I bet.
(WAGNER goes. RUTH sits down.)
RUTH. What was that about no hard feelings?
MILNE. Dick isn't very happy about the Globe using me. He's a
strong union man.
RUTH. And you're not.
MILNE. It's not that. It's just that I think journalism is ... special. Dick thinks I'm naïve about newspapers.
RUTH. And you're not?
MILNE. Do you think I am?
RUTH. I haven't really had time to form an opinion.
MILNE. He thinks the Globe is a million packets of journalism manufactured every week by businessmen using journalists for their labour, along with typesetters, dispatchers and all the rest.
RUTH. That is what the Globe is.
MILNE. No, it's not. A free press, free expression-it's the last
line of defence for all the other freedoms.
RUTH. I've formed an opinion.
MILNE. (Laughs) No, really—
RUTH. Why don't you sit down?
MILNE. No, thanks. I'm still-you know ...
RUTH. Would you like a drink?
MILNE. No, thanks.
RUTH. (Holding out her empty glass) Would you be good
enough... ? Straight scotch.
MILNE. (Taking the glass) Of course.
(RUTH gets up.)
RUTH. Watch yourself, Tallulah. (She walks to the verandah
steps.)
MILNE. (Doing the drink) Dick wants union membership to be a licence to practise. 'This man has been judged fit.' (He joins RUTH and gives her the scotch. She goes further into the garden and MILNE follows her. At some point the room pivots out leaving us with the two of them in the garden. The room is no doubt visible at the side of the stage.) Like doctors and lawyers, I suppose.
RUTH. Nothing wrong with that. Otherwise you'd have lawyers amputating the wrong leg. And doctors, um, trying their patients, ho, ho—
RUTH. You're giggling. Shut up.
RUTH. Mining engineers have the same sort of thing, I believe.
(Earnestly) Terribly interesting.
MILNE. What is?
RUTH. He's got you there.
RUTH. No-do go on. Professional standards. Don't you think
they're important?
MILNE. Oh, yes. But nothing could be further from Dick's mind.
He's honest about that. Others are less so. The fact is nobody's going to be drummed out of the NUJ for professional incompetence-persistent inaccuracy or illiteracy or getting drunk at the Lord Mayor's dinner. On the contrary it's the union which is going to keep them in their jobs. No, what Dick wants is a right-thinking press— one that thinks like him.
RUTH. So what? You'd like a right-thinking press, too. One that
thinks like you.
MINE. Sure I would, but I don't intend to get it by denying
employment to him.
RUTH. Perhaps you should.
MILNE. Think about it.
RUTH. (Pause) Yes, quite.
RUTH. Clarissa, who's this rather interesting young man?
MILNE. Once you establish the machinery it'll be there for someone else to use. Drum you out if you're too left-wing, or not left-wing enough, or the wrong colour, or something, RUTH. Well, it would be up to you, wouldn't it? Everybody's got
a vote.
MILNE. Everybody who's allowed in would have a vote, yes.
RUTH. You're an alarmist, Jacob. On the whole people behave
responsibly.
MILNE. On the whole because their behaviour is observed.
Reported.
RUTH. You're a cynic.
MILNE. Me?
RUTH. No, that can't be right.
MILNE. It wouldn't be like the Law Society or the BMA.
RUTH. It would in principle. If some group got control of the Law Society, they'd be just as free to have only right-thinking solicitors. What then?
MILNE. Then you'd really need a free press, otherwise you may never find out about it. That's the whole point. No matter how imperfect things are, if you've got a free press everything is correctable, and without it everything is concealable.
RUTH. I'm with you on the free press. It's the newspapers I
can't stand.
MILNE. (Laughs) I know what you mean. They let me down too.
Arguing with the Trots in the reporters room 'The press is the last hope for democracy!!' ... and I'd find I'm thumping my fist on some starlet's left nipple. You don't have to tell me, I know it better than you—the celebration of inanity, and the way real tragedy is paraphrased into an inflationary spiral of hackneyed melodramas Beauty Queen In Tug-Of-Love Baby Storm ... Tug-Of-Love Baby Mum
In Pools Win... Pools Man In Beauty Queen Drug Quiz.
I know. It's the price you pay for the part that matters.
RUTH. I like that one who's doing all the talking.
MILNE. It's not easy to defend, but it's mainly attacked for the wrong reasons. People think that rubbish-journalism is produced by men of discrimination who are vaguely ashamed of truckling to the lowest taste. But it's not. It's produced by people doing their best work. Proud of their expertise with a limited number of cheap devices to put a shine on the shit. Sorry. I know what I'm talking about because I started off like that, admiring it, trying to be that good, looking up to Fleet Street stringers, London men sometimes, on big local stories. I thought it was great. Some of the best times in my life have been spent sitting in a clapped-out Ford Consul outside a suburban house with a packet of Polos and twenty Players, waiting to grab a bereaved husband or a footballer's runaway wife who might be good for one front page between oblivion and oblivion. I felt part of a privileged group, inside society and yet outside it, with a licence to scourge it and a duty to defend it, night and day, the street of adventure, the fourth estate. And the thing is— I was dead right. That's what it was, and I was part of it because it's indivisible. Junk journalism is the evidence of a society that has got at least one thing right, that there should be nobody with the power to dictate where responsible journalism begins. (Pause) I'm sorry. I go on a bit. I'm not usually so wound up. It's been an amazing day.
I was the only reporter in Malakuangazi, you know. I mean, that story I sent over, it's probably the best story I'll ever get in my life.
RUTH. You must be tired.
MILNE. Not a bit.
RUTH. Hungry?
MILNE. Starving.
RUTH. Then let's eat.
MILNE. I'm sorry I talked so much.
RUTH. No. I like you to talk.
(She looks at him steadily, too long for his comfort.)
MILNE. Thanks very much for having me here. I'll go and sort
myself out.
RUTH. Run. Run, you stupid bitch.
(MILNE goes into the lighted house. RUTH stays in the dark.)
(Night into day.
RUTH has gone.
Dawn.
The jeep drives in. FRANCIS at the wheel. CARSON comes out of the house, shortly followed by GUTHRIE. GUTHRIE has changed some of his clothes, still blue denim or something non-military.
He has his camera bag and another shoulder bag. CARSON shouts up as though to an upstairs window.)
CARSON. Jake! (He turns and sees GUTHRIE.) All set? Where's
Jake?
GUTHRIE. What's that?
CARSON. Your jeep.
(CARSON goes to the jeep to say something to FRANCIS.
GUTHRIE stays right down stage.)
GUTHRIE. I can see it's a jeep. Wagner said a car.
CARSON. What's the difference? Car, jeep. This isn't a trip for a
family saloon.
(GUTHRIE is very angry and upset but still controlled.)
GUTHRIE. A family saloon is neutral. A jeep is a target. Listen-I know the game. I know the edge on every hand I'm dealt.
It was the same in the Congo, Angola, Somalia. And it's the same here.
(Then he sees that MILNE has come out of the house wearing army type clothing, including a camouflage-coloured cotton bush hat.)
(Explodes) Oh, bloody hell, he's dressed up like action man!
(GUTHRIE takes the hat off MILNE's head and throws it on the ground.)
MILNE. What's the matter?
(He picks up the hat.)
GUTHRIE. You don't drive into an African war in a khaki shirt
with epaulettes!
CARSON. What war? There isn't going to be any war today.
MILNE. I've got a tennis shirt in my bag-I'll change if you like.
GUTHRIE. Did you bring your racket? This is crazy. Wagner
should have done the trip.
MILNE. Thought you were on my side. Come on, Gigi-(MILNE goes towards the jeep, and towards CARSON.)
CARSON. Got it?
(MILNE pats the small bag he's carrying.)
MILNE. Got it. (MILNE gets into the jeep. FRANCIS guns the engine a little. GUTHRIE stands looking at the ground.) Well, are you coming or not?
GUTHRIE. (Quietly) Oh, shit.
(Then he moves quickly to the jeep, puts his camera bag on board and swings on behind as the jeep starts to move.)
(Blackout.)
Act Two
The room at night.
The room occupies the whole stage now.
RUTH sits in one of the comfortable chairs. She is wearing a long dress, not formal but loose and comfortable, perhaps a kaftan; more dressed up than we have seen her, rich material but not gaudy. She sits facing the audience.
The room is not brightly lit, and the edges are in gloom.
MILNE stands at the edge of the room, having just entered. He is dressed the way we first saw him.
RUTH doesn't turn round.
RUTH. Hello, Jacob, I'm glad it's you. I've been holding my breath since I heard the jeep. I'm glad you're back. I missed you, Jake. Actually, Jake, I ... Christ, I've been missing you, Jake...
(RUTH turns round.)
MILNE. Hello.
RUTH. Oh—hello!
MILNE. Thought you were having a snooze.
RUTH. No, no. Good trip?
MILNE. Yes, thanks. Piece of cake.
RUTH. Lots of scoops?
MILNE. Masses.
RUTH. Come and sit down. Have a drink.
MILNE. No thanks. Where's Geoffrey?
RUTH. He's away.
MILNE. I thought everybody would be asleep.
RUTH. I felt like waiting up. Are you all right?
MILNE. Never better. (RUTH laughs.) What's up?
RUTH. Nothing. I like the way you have such a good time.
Dashing around for the glory of the Globe. Grimsby man in Globe glory dash.
MILNE. You do think I'm naive.
RUTH. No I don't.
MILNE. Too young and romantic.
RUTH. That's different.
MILNE. I expect I'll end up like Dick.
RUTH. I hope not.
MILNE. Dick's all right. He's a bit...
RUTH. Wagnerian. (English pronunciation.)
MILNE. I suppose he's gone off with the press corps.
RUTH. I suppose so. It's nice that you've got us to come
back to.
MILNE. Yes—a line to London on tap—one couldn't ask for more. Oh-and present company included, of course.
RUTH. Help.
MILNE. Well, I expect you'd like to go to bed.
RUTH. I'm over here.
MILNE. I've got a piece to write.
RUTH. To hell with that.
MILNE. You won't mind if I try to get London later?
RUTH. And to hell with London.
MILNE. I'm sure Geoffrey wouldn't mind. Is he in KC?
RUTH. Why don't you shut up and kiss me.
MILNE. He said I could help myself.
RUTH. So kiss me.
MILNE. Perhaps I should try for a line first—let them know I'm
here.
RUTH. I would prefer you to kiss me.
MILNE. Kiss you?
(Pause. RUTH blinks and turns to him.)
RUTH. Yes.
MINE. Well... um, I was just saying, I ought to establish
contact with the office.
RUTH. Yes. I think that would be a very sensible idea.
MILE. Thank you.
RUTH. But isn't it rather late, or early, or something?
MILNE. It is here.
RUTH. Oh yes. We seem to have got off the subject.
MILNE. Have you been out this evening?
RUTH. No. Why?
MILNE. You look—a bit dressed up.
RUTH. This old thing? I just threw it on as I stepped out of the
shower.
MILNE. Ah. Jolly nice.
RUTH. Wouldn't do for the club at all.
MILNE. Is there a club?
RUTH. The Jeddu Country Club. Very quiet since independence.
They used to have Coronation dances, I believe. Now it's billiards, bar and smoking room. I don't play billiards but I drink and smoke. And they get all the important magazines Country Life, Mining Review, Kambawe Today ... and, you'll be pleased to know, some of the London papers.
MILNE. Doesn't sound bad at all. Are they flown in?
RUTH. I don't think so. We're still getting the Morning Post. It's
all right, you don't have to kiss me at all.
MILNE. It isn't that I don't think you're attractive.
RUTH. No. It's just that Geoffrey has been damned decent to
you…
MILNE. Well, yes. And even if he hadn't ...
RUTH. It wouldn't be right to make free with his possessions-his
ox, his ass, his wife—
MILNE. Wait a minute. (He pauses, concentrating for four or five
seconds-he looks at her.) No.
RUTH. Well, I'm glad it wasn't instantaneous.
MILNE. I mean your argument. It sounds good but it's not. I
might make free with his ox and his ass - or his jeep- because they are merely his possessions. But if I indulged my desire for you I would be numbering you among them.
As it is, it seems I regard a wife as different from a jeep, which puts me in the forefront of enlightened thinking.
(Smiles) Wouldn't you say?
RUTH. What desire for me?
MILNE. Oh, crikey.
RUTH. Had any lewd thoughts?
MILNE. I told you I found you attractive.
RUTH. Tell me about the lewd thoughts.
MILNE. No.
RUTH. Oh, come on. Don't be such a spoil-sport. There you are, in the jeep. The sun beats down. Bwana Guthrie is taking pictures of nature and poverty for the colour magazine.
Tracker Francis is keeping his eye on the road. Your thoughts drift... 'I say, that Ruth Carson, she's all woman. Carry on from there. (MILNE won't.) Did you undress me?
MILNE. No.
RUTH. I kept my clothes on?
MILNE. You undressed yourself.
RUTH. Ah. Was it dark or daylight? On a bed? On the floor?
Long grass? In the jeep? (Pause) It was in the jeep.
MILNE. (Sharply) No, it wasn't. (Pause) It was in a parallel world. No day or night, no responsibilities, no friction, almost no gravity.
RUTH. 1 know it. How was I?
MILNE. (Exasperated) Ruth.
RUTH. You were good. It's about time you called me Ruth.
MILNE. Show some, then. RUTH. that which is lacking in
ruthlessness. It comes into Milton. 'Look homeward angel," now, and melt with ruth? Compassion-contrition.
Something like that.
RUTH. I'm not really a tart.
MILNE. No-of course.
RUTH. I was almost a tart with my first husband, but he was a rotter in his own way. He was frankly proud of his left-hook.
MILNE. Was he?
RUTH. Unjustifiably so. You could slip it quite easily and with a right-cross. What a way to live. To get me, all"
Bet him
MILNE. Did you love him too?
Geoffrey had to do was clear his throat and hold the door.
RUTH. Of course I loved him-loved Africa. Just like Deborah Kerr in King Solomon's Mines before the spider got into her underwear. And I haven't been a tart with Geoffrey, Slipped once, but that was in a hotel room and hotel rooms shouldn't count as infidelity. They constitute a separate moral universe. Anyway, I had terrible PCR, and a tart wouldn't, would she?
MILNE. What's PCR?
RUTH. Post-coital remorse. Post-coital ruth. Quite needlessly-1 mean, it's a bit metaphysical to feel guilt about the idea of Geoffrey being hurt if Geoffrey is in a blissful state of ignorance-don't you think?
MILNE. No.
RUTH. No. Fresh start. Hello!-had a good trip? (Pause) I don't
know. I got into a state today.
(RUTH's fingers play on the arm of her chair: distant piano is heard-T've Got You Under My Skin'-just a fragment of it
-it is interrupted by MILNE.)
MILNE. What sort of state?
RUTH. Itchy. I'm telling you this because it is interesting, you understand. Went to bed feeling nothing more dangerous than a heightened sense of you being in the house. Woke up fluttering with imminent risk. Quite a pleasant feeling, really. Like walking along the top board knowing you don't have to jump. But a desperate feeling, too, because if you're not going to jump what the hell are you doing up there? So I got dressed to say goodbye to you. Really. Dressed for it.
'What shall I wear to say goodbye to Jake?' Don't feel flattered. You look like you look, and you've got a way of being gauche which suggests that you've got the edge on people who know the ground and prepare their effects-I
was attracted, as it happens, but it's like throwing a pair when you've got three-of-a-kind on the table. This time, bingo, but no use at all to anyone looking for a straight.
Anyway, while I was dressing for this intensely laconic farewell, you'd been gone an hour. Geoffrey hadn't wanted to wake me. He's thoughtful about things like that. Saying goodbye would have taken care of it, I expect. It was finding you gone that did it. Quietus interruptus. I went peculiar. I lost my view to hai. sad unob ay son, Your sheets
MILNE. You were good, too. (Pause) You shouldn't try to make it sound like a free ride. 'Geoffrey will never know and I'm not his chattel so there's nothing to pay? There are no free rides. You always pay.
RUTH. Take it, then, and pay. Be a bastard. Behave badly.
MILNE. That's better.
RUTH. Betray your benefactor.
MILNE. That's right.
RUTH. Corrupt me.
MILNE. Put it like that, I might.
RUTH. Steal me.
MILNE. I want to.
RUTH. Good. Mess up my life. I'll pay.
MILNE. Stupid.
RUTH. Don't be frightened.
MILNE. And tomorrow—
RUTH. I'll pack if you like. If you don't like, I'll stay and deadhead the bougainvillaea. Either way I'll pay.
(They kiss on the mouth, but not passionately and not holding each other.)
MILNE. Leave me alone. You should know better.
RUTH. I do know better. To hell with that.
(She lets herself fall over backwards on to the sofa.* Only her calves and feet are visible.)
MILNE. You're really something, Ruth. I don't know what.
* At least that would be one way of doing this moment.
(MILNE turns and walks up-stage into the darle and disappears.
RUTH's feet disappear out of sight behind the sofa and then ' she (double) stands up with her back to the audience looking towards where MILNE disappeared, undoes her dress and steps out of it (she has nothing on underneath) holding on to the dres with one hand and trailing it after her as she follows MIlANB into the dark. Before she has disappeared CARSON has walked unhurriedly, relaxed, into the room from the side of the stage.
He lights a cigarette and stands thoughtfully watching as RUTH moves into the dark. After a moment or two, behind him,
RUTH's voice:)
RUTH. Got a cigarette? (She is lying on the sofa behind CARSON.
He turns and offers her a cigarette. RUTH's hand comes into view to take it.) Thanks. (CARSON offers his lighter and RUTH's head comes up to meet it. She stands and lights her cigarette from his lighter.)
CARSON. There's no need for you to stay up.
RUTH. I want to.
CARSON. He may not come for hours.
RUTH. I'm all right. What time is it?
CARSON. (Looks at his watch) Saturday. Nearly one. You got
dressed up for him.
RUTH. Well, he is the President.
(The dog starts barking. CARSON moves to a light switch and the exterior lights come on. Sound of an approaching vehicle.
CARSON leaves the room. RUTH moves to a chair. She puts out her cigarette. The vehicle has arrived. CARSON's voice audible off-stage.)
CARSON. (OS) Oh-God!
WAGNER. (A few yards off) Hello!
CARSON. (OS) Any other time, old man—
WAGNER. (OS) I saw your lights from the road.
CARSON. (Entering) Ruth and I were just going to bed.
(WAGNER comes in behind CARSON.)
WAGNER. Good evening. I brought a nightcap. (He's carrying a bottle of Cutty Sark whisky, not a full one.) Compliments of the firm. I'm afraid I've started without you. (He's making himself at home. He puts the bottle down.) I saw the lights as I was passing.
RUTH. The lights weren't on as you were passing.
CARSON. Look, Dick, not this time, there's a good fellow.
WAGNER. Have a heart all this way for a nightcap.
CARSON. You said you were passing-WAGNER. To see if you were up.
CARSON. Well, we were just turning in, weren't we, darling? Why don't you drop in tomorrow-today, for heaven's sake-for a sundowner.
RUTH. Leave off, Geoffrey-he knows. (To WAGNER.) You do
know, don't you?
WAGNER. Oh, absolutely.
CARSON. Knows what?
RUTH. He knows we're waiting for Mageeba.
CARSON. (Angrily) Ruth ...
WAGNER. Mageeba-that's the fellow.
CARSON. It's a social call. He likes to eat late.
WAGNER. Doesn't he, though?
CARSON. Well, there you are.
WAGNER. Yes, indeed. When is Colonel Shimbu supposed to be
coming?
CARSON. He's not coming.
RUTH. (Simultaneously) In the morning. He's not coming in the
morning.
CARSON. This is dreadful.
WAGNER. I'll be as quiet as a mouse.
CARSON. Mageeba is going to be furious. You'll be lucky if you
don't end up under arrest.
WAGNER. I'm your house guest.
CARSON. No, you're not.
RUTH. Oh, do let him. He could crawl under the sofa. (To WAGNER.) You'll feel quite at home, it's almost like a bed.
I'll bet you're better under a bed than in it.
CARSON. Stop this.
WAGNER. Vouch for me, then. Lobby basis, I promise.
CARSON. What do you mean, lobby basis?- this is the President of Kambawe, not some Downing Street PR man. Journalists here get hung up by their thumbs for getting his medals wrong.
WAGNER. Charming fellow, your boss.
CARSON. He's not my boss. He's the President, that's all, I can't help who's President. I'm a mining engineer.
WAGNER. They're his mines.
CARSON. They were here first and so was I. They're my bloody
mines more than his.
RUTH. And more Shimbu's than yours now.
WAGNER. True. Do you think Shimbu will show up?
CARSON. As it happens I don't. Not unless he's got a fool-proof triple-cross to put over on the double-cross he'd be expecting from Mageeba.
WAGNER. It is like Downing Street.
CARSON. How did you know about all this?
WAGNER. I was guessing about Shimbu. On Mageeba I had my
own source.
CARSON. Yes, I bet-Canadian loud-mouth.
WAGNER. What Canadian loud-mouth is that?
CARSON. You know about the UN team, do you?
WAGNER. Up to a point, Lord Copper.
CARSON. UN observers, they've been in KC since Sunday.
WAGNER. Shimbu's letter was to the UN not to Mageeba... ?
CARSON. I'll brief you if you promise to leave.
WAGNER. Sounds fair.
CARSON. Mageeba wants his mines back. Last year they produced nearly sixty per cent of his copper-you read that in the Kambawe Citizen. The mines are no good to Shimbu because the railway goes the wrong way. You saw that on a map. So Shimbu will swop the mines for recognition of Adoma. Pretty good going—I steal your clothes and offer to give back your trousers if I can keep your shirt. He wants to talk through the UN people. To show good faith he says
he won't fire a shot until he's fired upon.
WAGNER. Sounds sincere.
CARSON. Sounds as if he hasn't got all his armour up. Anyway, Mageeba bought it, he said he'd show up here with the Canadians at dawn, ready to talk. Half-way house, you see.
WAGNER. I'll believe the Canadians when I see them.
CARSON. Me too. Everybody's lying.
WAGNER. Tell me what you think.
CARSON. I think Shimbu wants the whole apple, and is using the time to get his supply line working. I think Mageeba isn't going to let Shimbu secede anywhere except into a ditch, and at breakfast time when he sees Shimbu hasn't fallen for it, he's going to go in with air-strikes and tanks and lose half of them in a week, and appeal to the free world about Russian interference. I also think that the British and the Americans will protest, and all the time they're protesting the Russians will be interfering the shit out of Mageeba's army, until Kambawe is about as independent as Lithuania, and that the British and Americans will protest.
WAGNER. I see. I'll make sure the Globe puts that over.
CARSON. You'll what—?
WAGNER. I said I'll make sure the Globe— (But CARSON is already laughing heartily.)
CARSON. Oh good! Oh wonderful! The Globe will pronounce!
We're saved-the Prime Minister will be straight on to the Foreign Office— (He mimes winding up an old-fashioned telephone while holding the ear-piece.) 'Now look here, have you seen what those Russkies are up to in Africa?-the Queen is absolutely furious and so is Albert!'
WAGNER. All right.
RUTH. Poor Dick.
CARSON. Well... there you are.
WAGNER. Thanks, Geoff.
CARSON. You said you'd leave.
WAGNER. I was lying.
CARSON. I'm beginning to wonder if you can be altogether.
WAGNER. I'm sorry, but nobody on this story has got a sight of Mageeba since it broke. Let alone a quote. Let alone an interview. Let alone this Shimbu deal. It's too big to pass up and I'm greedy for it- I admit that. I'm going to put the Globe so far out in front this Sunday, those roving correspondents and African specialists and line-shooters and bullshitters won't keep down their dinner for a week.
CARSON. Serve you right if he doesn't show up. He seldom does
what he says.
(But a car is becoming audible.)
WAGNER. If he hadn't shown up I'd still be watching the compound. I saw him land fifteen minutes ago. Also two Sea King helicopters. Do you think they're full of Canadian lawyers?
(The car is getting louder.)
CARSON. Are you going?
WAGNER. No.
CARSON. Be careful if he laughs.
(CARSON goes out to meet the car.)
RUTH. You're shaking.
WAGNER. That's because I'm scared.
RUTH. I'm beginning to like you a little. Now that I can see through you. You're just like Jake, really. My paper 'tis of thee. If you two were just a little brighter you'd remind me of Batman and Robin.
WAGNER. What do I call him?
RUTH. He likes to be called boy.
WAGNER. For Christ's sake. Don't leave the room.
(Then MAGEEBA is in, followed by Carson. MAGEEBA is in uniform, open-necked shirt, informal but well laundered and wearing medal-ribbon. He carries a short cane with a metal knob.)
RUTH. Good evening, Your Excellency ... how kind of you to
honour us.
MAGEEBA. Mrs Carson ... a pleasure... a beautiful home and a beautiful hostess. Please forgive this late hour.
RUTH. It's never too late— welcome ... we're night birds here.
MAGEEBA. How gracious... I, too, sleep very little.
RUTH. (Gaily) Well-uneasy lies the head that—
RUTH. (Loudly) Idiot!
RUTH. I mean the sheer volume of work must be enormous, the
cares of State, and—
RUTH. Shut up, you silly woman—
RUTH. May I introduce Mr Richard Wagner?
MAGEEBA. Mr Wagner.
WAGNER. Sir-your most-er—Excellency—
RUTH. Compose yourself, Wagner.
MAGEEBA. You are a visitor to Kambawe?
WAGNER. Yes, sir.
CARSON. Would you care for anything, sir?
MAGEEBA. What brings you to Kambawe?
WAGNER. You do, sir-your determined stand against Russian imperialism in Africa has won the admiration of the British people, sir-
RUTH. Jesus Christ.
WAGNER. And I feel very privileged myself to have the
opportunity to—
(MAGEEBA stops him with an upraised hand.)
MAGEEBA. (Triumphantly) Ah! (To CARSON.) Your guest is a
journalist.
CARSON. I'm very sorry about this, sir-Mr Wagner arrived a few minutes ago quite by chance—he was just leaving—
RUTH. For London.
MAGEEBA. How I envy him. I have very happy memories of London. Student days, you know. I learned everything about economic theory. It has proved a great handicap.
(To RUTH.) How are things in London, Mrs Carson?
RUTH. Oh-did you know I'd been?
MAGEEBA. My cousin tells me of all interesting and distinguished
travellers.
RUTH. You have a cousin at the airport?
MAGEEBA. No, at the Court of St James.
RUTH. Say goodnight, Gracie.
RUTH. Oh good.
MAGEEBA. But I also have a cousin at the airport, of course.
MAGEEBA. You see, I know everything. How is young Alexander
finding London?
RUTH. Oh... he's a wild success, I believe, much respected...
CARSON. (Hurriedly) He's staying with friends in Kamba City,
sir-school-friend, you know—
RUTH. Oh yes ... young Allie ...
MAGEEBA. You see, Mrs Carson, I am like a father to all Kambaweans. In your case, of course, I have to say an adopted father.
RUTH. Of course.
RUTH. Wrong
MAGEEBA. Such is our legacy of racial and cultural prejudice.
RUTH. Yes, indeed.
RUTH. (Loudly) Geoffrey!!
(WAGNER decides to make his pitch and to do so quite formally.
The effect is more wooden than formal.)
WAGNER. Your Excellency-Sir ... I hope you will forgive my presence but as I say, the British people are watching with intense and sympathetic interest your courageous stand against the communist menace in Africa, and if you, sir, have any words of reassurance-however few-any message for the British people-and indeed the world-the Sunday Globe would be privileged to publish them.
(Pause. MAGEEBA has been deciding on a chair and sinking himself into it. Now he looks up and looks at WAGNER apologetically.)
MAGEEBA. I'm so sorry-Mr Wagner-were you speaking to me?
WAGNER. (Bravely) Yes, sir. I was saying, Your Excellency, that the British people are following with intense admiration and interest your ... er ... courageous stand against the communist threat in Africa... sir...
MAGEEBA. Yes?
WAGNER. Yes, sir, and if you have any message for the British people- and indeed the world well, my paper would be privileged to publish it.
MAGEEBA. (Pause) The Sunday Globe.
(WAGNER nods.)
RUTH. You're bitched, Wagner.
CARSON. Well, Dick, it's time you were off.
MAGEBBA. Is Mr Wagner a friend of yours, Geoffrey?
CARSON. No-
RUTH. (Simultaneously) Oh, rather. We met in London. I'm terribly fond of him. (To WAGNER.) I'll see you to the door.
MAGEEBA. Please! Do you have to leave, Mr Wagner?
WAGNER. Not at all.
MAGEEBA. Then you must stay. I am interested to meet you. We
must have a good talk. Sit down there.
WAGNER. Thank you, sir.
CARSON. Your Excellency ...
MAGEEBA. Yes, you were saying, Geoffrey-a little whisky and
water, then.
CARSON. Of course. Would you like the malt?
MAGEEBA. Not with water.
CARSON. No—of course.
MAGEEBA. The blended, about half and half, no ice.
CARSON. Whisky and water, no ice.
WAGNER. That will do me nicely, without the water. (WAGNER is transformed, secure, pleased with himself.) So I don't mind a bit of malt if you can spare it.
(CARSON uses WAGNER's bottle of Cutty Sark for the drinks.)
CARSON. (To RUTH) Darling?
RUTH. Nothing.
CARSON. Ruth has arranged for a little late supper to be laid out in the dining room if you should care for something, sir.
RUTH. He's not going to have room for a thing after Wagner.
MAGEEBA. Mr ... Wagner.
WAGNER. Mr ... President. Sir.
MAGEEBA. Mr Wagner, it is not you, is it, who has to be congratulated on the Sunday Globes interview with Colonel Shimbu?
WAGNER. That wasn't me, sir, no. As a matter of fact, it wasn't a Globe reporter at all, it was a young freelance chap who found himself caught up with Shimbu quite by accident. Of course when he sent it to the Globe, they were bound to use
MAGEEBA. 'The press lives by disclosure.'
it, because well, all the news that's fit to print, as they say.
WAGNER. Ah, you know that one.
MAGEEBA. Delaney of The Times-we had all that at the LSE.
The political history of communications, or some such course. (He accepts his drink from CARSON.) Thank you. And
C. P. Scott of the Manchester Guardian, of course—
'Comment is free but facts are sacred.'
WAGNER. Yes, and 'Comment is free but facts are on expenses?
MAGEEBA. Scott?
WAGNER. Wagner. (He takes his drink.) Cheers.
MAGEEBA. What did you think of the interview by the way?
WAGNER. Ah, well, (He looks for safe ground.) —these chaps, they even talk like puppets, don't they? I think it's useful in a way to let them have their say. For that reason. Of course, sir, if you felt that some reply—or refutation-was indicated, I need hardly say that I, or rather the Globe—
MAGEEBA. You would give me equal space?
WAGNER. Oh-absolutely—
MAGEEBA. That's very fair. Isn't it Geoffrey? Mr Wagner says I
can have equal space.
WAGNER. And some space is more equal than others. I think, sir, I could more or less guarantee that an interview with you at this juncture of the war would be treated as the main news story of the day, and of course would be picked up by newspapers, and all the media, round the world.
MAGEEBA. What war, Mr Wagner?
WAGNER. Sorry?
MAGEEBA. Kambawe is not at war. We have a devolution problem.
I believe you have one, too.
WAGNER. A dévolution problem? Yes... I see. Do you mind, sir, if I make a note or two?
(MAGEEBA waves permission and WAGNER takes a note book from his pocket.)
MAGBEBA. If it is a war it is not of my waging. I am a man of peace... (He waits for WAGNER and repeats as he writes.) man of peace. When a man strikes me without cause or warning, I invite him to breakfast. Don't I, Geoffrey?
CARSON. I have told Mr Wagner that this is a social call, sir.
MAGEEBA. Quite right. I am going to have breakfast with
Shimbu. At least—I have invited him to breakfast, I can do no more than that, and I don't mind at all, Mr Wagner, that you are here to witness my good faith.
WAGNER. Do you think Shimbu will come?
MAGEEBA. I think he might come if he is still his own master. He would come early, perhaps, and bring his own food, but I think he would come. It would be to his advantage now to come to the breakfast table with a reasonable and peace-loving man. His methods have been piratical but his cause is not without interest. Our frontiers, you know, are still the frontiers of colonialism. Adoma has its own language, an ancient culture, and the people are of distinct appearance.
This does not mean that Adoma could prosper as an independent nation-frankly it could not, except as the hand-maiden of its so-called liberators, and I think Shimbu will see that there is more true independence in being, let us say, an autonomous state federated to Kambawe.
WAGNER. Are you offering that, sir?
MAGEEBA. I would consider a referendum. But of course that would depend on an immediate withdrawal from his present aggressive positions.
WAGNER. The Malakuangazi mines.
MAGEEBA. I don't think Geoffrey would accept anything less.
CARSON. He did rather come in without knocking.
MAGEEBA. And of course there is the question of uninvited foreigners. At this moment on Kambawe soil we have
Russians, Cubans, Yemeni and Libyans. We even have a few Czech and German mechanics, I'm told. The American Ambassador asked me if I would let the United Nations come in. I said, half of them are already here working for Shimbu.
WAGNER. Is there any UN presence in Kamba City yet?
MAGEEBA. No.
WAGNER. I see. And what if Shimbu doesn't come to the table
and doesn't withdraw?
MAGEEBA. Then, Mr Wagner, you may call it a war.
WAGNER. When may I do that, sir?
MAGEEBA. Would ten o'clock suit you?
(WAGNER grins, drains his glass and holds it out to CARSON.) WAGNER. (To CARSON) May I ... ? (To MAGEEBA.) Do you have
what you need to win the war?
MAGEEBA. If it's a short war.
WAGNER. And if it's not? Are you looking to us and the
Americans?
MAGEEBA. I'd be a fool to do that. Your record of cowardice in
Africa stretches from Angola to Eritrea.
CARSON. Lobby basis, Dick.
MAGEEBA. No—no—I don't believe in that. They asked me if they could appoint a lobby correspondent in KC. I said, fine, tell him to go and sit in the Sheraton, it's the most comfortable lobby in town. I know the British press is very attached to the lobby system. It lets the journalists and the politicians feel proud of their traditional freedoms while giving the reader as much of the truth as they think is good for him. I have some experience of the British press. When you granted us our independence-as the rules of hospitality oblige me to refer to the military victory of the Nationalist Front-the Kambawe paper was the property of an English gentleman. Isn't that so, Geoffrey?
CARSON. Well, not exactly, sir—
MAGEEBA. Not exactly a gentleman, no, but a rich Englishman with a title. So there we were, an independent country, and the only English newspaper was still part of a British Empire
-a family empire a chain of newspapers a fleet of newspapers, shall I say? Yes, that's very good, not a chain but a fleet of newspapers. That's good, isn't it, Mr Wagner?
WAGNER. Yes... you mean like a convoy?
RUTH. He means like Fleet Street, you fool.
MAGEEBA. Fleet Street—
WAGNER. Oh yes—very good—
MAGBEB. Of course, we had many businesses controlled by overseas interests, we still have many, and we have many more partnerships- even the Kambawe Mining Corporation is such a partnership and you can see from that, can you not, Mr Wagner, that we have no prejudice against English gentlemen as such—but a newspaper, a newspaper is not like a mine, or a bank, or an airline; it is the voice of the people and the Kambawe paper was the voice of an English millionaire.
WAGNER. Which one?
CARSON. Yours, Dick.
WAGNER. Oh ... somewhat before my time, sir.
MAGEEBA. Nothing personal, Mr Wagner.
WAGNER. Good God, I hold no brief for him.
MAGEEBA. I realize of course that you are only an able-seaman on
the flag-ship.
WAGNER. Well, sir, we've come a long way since we were galley slaves. Northcliffe could sack a man for wearing the wrong hat. Literally. There was a thing called the Daily Mail hat and he expected his reporters to wear it. Until he got interested in something else. Aeroplanes or wholemeal bread... Those days are gone.
MAGEBBA. Indeed, Mr Wagner, now the hat is metaphorical only.
WAGNER. With respect, sir, you underestimate the strength of the organized workers the journalists. I admit that even when I started in newspapers a proprietor could sack any reporter, who, as it were, insisted on wearing the wrong hat, but things are very different now.
RUTH. Now the union can sack him instead.
WAGNER. I see that young Milne has been bending your ear.
RUTH. Young Milne? (She doesn't quite hide her anger.) Yes, 1 suppose you can afford to patronize him now.
CARSON. Perhaps we're getting a little off the President's point, MAGEEBA. And perhaps not. I'm most interested in what you
have to say, Mr Wagner.
WAGNER. We have a mutual friend who believes that the freedom of the journalist is safer in the hands of the proprietors than in the hands of his fellow journalists.
RUTH. Well, of course it is, you fool. Even Northcliffe could only sack you from his own newspapers, and nowadays he'd be answerable to one of those industrial tribunals which make banks compensate their sacked embezzlers... and he'd have to think twice if you were anything special because he'd know that in short order you would be working for the competition. But you'd better be damned careful if you cross your fellow journalists because they would stop you working for any newspaper in the land, no matter how good a reporter you are; and they are answerable to nobody.
WAGNER. They are answerable to a democratically elected body
representing the membership.
RUTH. Wagner, are you completely daft?
CARSON. Ruth ...
RUTH. In your utopia will the burglars be answerable to a democratically elected body of safe crackers?
MAGEEBA. (Enjoying this) Ha! Mr Wagner?
WAGNER. Well, without the democracy, that was very much the situation when rich and powerful men in commerce were only answerable to rich and powerful men in the establishment.
I'm with the President on this one, if I may say so. I believe that a newspaper, although it is a business, is too important to be merely somebody's property. And I'm not talking about protecting my job but my freedom to report facts that may not be congenial to, let us say, an English millionaire.
MAGEEBA. Mrs Carson?
RUTH. I think I'll have that drink after all.
(CARSON goes to get it for her.)
I have difficulty in controlling myself when I'm completely
sober.
CARSON. This comes of having journalists in the house, I suppose... I didn't know you felt so passionately about newspapers, Ruth. Against them, perhaps.
RUTH. I'm against cant. 'Congenial to English millionaires!' The whole country is littered with papers pushing every political line from Mao to Mosley and back again, and I bet even Allie could work out for himself that it is the very free-for-all which guarantees the freedom of each. You don't have to be a millionaire to contradict one. It isn't the millionaires who are going to stop you, it's the Wagners who don't trust the public to choose the marked card.
WAGNER. I'm talking about national papers. It's absurd to equate the freedom of the big battalions with the freedom of a basement pamphleteer to challenge them.
RUTH. You are confusing freedom with ability. The Flat Earth News is free to sell a million copies. What it lacks is the ability to find a million people with four pence and a conviction that the earth is flat. Freedom is neutral. Free expression includes a state of affairs where any millionaire can have a national newspaper, if that's what it costs. A state of affairs where only a particular, approved, licensed and supervised non-millionaire can have a newspaper is called, for example, Russia.
MAGEEBA. Or, of course, Kambawe.
RUTH. (Shouts) Geoffrey!
CARSON. I'm sorry, sir—I know Ruth didn't mean— MAGEEBA. (Placatingly) Please!
RUTH. No—of course not—I mean, the Daily Citizen isn't
state-controlled.
MAGEEBA. Please don't concern yourself. I enjoy a free and open debate. It is a luxury which a man in my position can seldom afford. And I admit that by the highest ideals the Daily Citizen is open to criticism. But you must remember it is the only English language paper we have. The population cannot yet support a number of competing papers offering a natural balance of opinion.
CARSON. Exactly.
MAGEEBA. At the time of independence the Daily Citizen was undoubtedly free. It was free to select the news it thought fit to print, to make much of it, or little, and free to make room for more and more girls wearing less and less underwear. You may smile, but does freedom of the press mean freedom to choose its own standards?
CARSON. Absolutely.
MAGEEBA. Mrs Carson?
RUTH. What's the alternative?
MAGEEBA. That was the question. Easy enough to shut the paper down, as I would have been obliged to do had it not been burned down during the state of emergency which followed independence. But what to put in its place? The English millionaire folded his singed tents and stole away the insurance money, which didn't belong to him since I had nationalized the paper well before the fire was out. Never mind-the field was open. I did not believe a newspaper should be part of the apparatus of the state; we are not a totalitarian society. But neither could I afford a return to the whims of private enterprise. I had the immense and delicate task of restoring confidence in Kambawe. I could afford the naked women but not the naked scepticism, the carping and sniping and the public washing of dirty linen which represents freedom to an English editor. What then?
A democratic committee of journalists?—a thicket for the editor to hide in. No, no-freedom with responsibility, that was the elusive formula we pondered all those years ago at the LSE. And that is what I found. From the ashes there arose, by public subscription, a new Daily Citizen, responsible and relatively free. (He leans towards WAGNER.) Do you know what I mean by a relatively free press, Mr Wagner?
WAGNER. Not exactly, sir, no.
MACBEBA. I mean a free press which is edited by one of my relatives.
(He throws back his head and laughs. WAGNER joins in uncertainty. RUTH smiles nervously. CARSON looks scared.
MAGEEBA brings the weighted end of his stick down on
WAGNER's head.)
(Shouting) So it doesn't go crawling to uppity niggers!- so it doesn't let traitors shit on the front page!-so it doesn't go sucking up to liars and criminals! 'Yes sir, Colonel Shimbu, tell us about the exploitation of your people!— free speech for all here, Colonel Shimbu, tell us about the wonderful world you're going to build in that vulture's garbage dump you want to call a country'—yes, you tell us before you get a machine-gun up your backside and your brains coming down your nostrils!-who's going to interview you then, Colonel, sir!
(MAGEEBA has stood up and moved away from WAGNER.
WAGNER's head is bleeding slightly above the hairline.)
(Evenly) I'll give him equal space. Six foot long and six foot deep, just like any other traitor and communist jackal.
(GUTHRIE has entered. He is somewhat the worse for wear. He glances round the room and then ignores everybody and walks diagonally right down-stage to where WAGNER is. His words are only for WAGNER.) GUTHRIE. Dick. Jacob's dead.
CARSON. (In response to MAGEEBA's glance of enquiry) This is
Mr Guthrie, Your Excellency, he is also from-er-London-(GUTHRIE crosses to MAGEEBA and stands close to him.)
GUTHRIE. Are you the President of this shit-house country?
WAGNER. George…
GUTHRIE. Is it you runs that drunken duck-shoot calls itself an
army?
(WAGNER and CARSON are moving in on him. WAGNER grabs GUTHRIE and starts pulling him away.)
(Shouts) I don't call that a fucking cease-fire! I hope they blow their fucking heads off!
(WAGNER has got GUTHRIE back down into a chair, and holds him down. RUTH comes forward and kneels on the floor by GUTHRIE and talks straight into his face.)
RUTH. Where's Jacob?
GUTHRIE. In the jeep.
RUTH. In the jeep? What's he doing there?
GUTHRIE. Not a lot.
(RUTH starts to leave.)
(Sharply) Don't turn him over—he'll come away in your hand.
(RUTH moans and sinks down where she is.)
WAGNER. Jesus.
CARSON. I'm sorry. What happened?
GUTHRIE. We never got to Shimbu.
MAGEEBA. Your messenger, Geoffrey?
CARSON. Yes. (To GUTHRIE.) Have you got the letter?
GUTHRIE. Jake had it. I suppose it's still in his bag.
(CARSON leaves the room.)
(To WAGNER) You've got blood on your head.
MAGEEBA. Well, Mrs Carson. I must say goodnight. Thank you for your gracious hospitality. (To WAGNER.) I will remember what you said, Mr Wagner.
WAGNER. What was that ... sir?
MAGEEBA. Why, that my determined stand against communist imperialism is being watched with admiration by the British people.
WAGNER. Oh, yes.
MAGEEBA. I enjoyed our discussion. I'm sorry if I was rude
about your hat.
(MAGEEBA leaves.)
GUTHRIE. He hit you? Because he didn't like your hat?
WAGNER. That's right. What happened to Jacob?
GUTHRIE. It was right outside Malakuangazi. Just getting dark. It took us twice as long to get there as Geoffrey said.
Mageeba's pass worked but it worked slowly, Everybody scared stiff of getting their ears chopped off for letting us through, and also for not letting us through. Same thing round here, I mean the road to the house. There's soldiers behind every tree. A real back-up to the peace initiative.
WAGNER. Yeah, he was going to have Shimbu for breakfast all
right.
GUTHRIE. These are the good guys. We get accredited by the
good guys.
RUTH. I want to know what happened.
(MAGEEBA's car has been heard to leave. CARSON enters.)
GUTHRIE. We eventually got to the front, which is where the cover runs out. You could see Malakuangazi across a strip of open land, no dead ground. We had the headlights on, acting friendly, and a white handkerchief tied to the aerial, but it was just about dark, they couldn't see what was coming. We got a couple of hundred yards, and they put up a flare. That was okay. But somebody behind us got nervous and let off a few rounds. You know-shooting at a town with a rifle-that sort of discipline. So that gets somebody else excited, and pretty soon there's a cross-fire, and another fare, and we're the only moving object in sight. There's only one smart thing to do and the driver knows it. He stops the jeep and runs and I shouted to Jake to run and I got fifty yards and when I looked back he's in the driving seat trying to turn the jeep round. He got it round, and then he was hit. Knocked him into the back seat. I should have looked after him better. Stupid sod. Up 'til then he was having a good time.
WAGNER. You went back to the jeep.
GUTHRIE. I didn't know if he was dead. Engine was okay. Only the windscreen smashed. So I killed the lights and drove it back. But he was dead all right. A whole burst, head and shoulders. Heavy machine-gun, I should think, just spraying around. He didn't know anything about it anyway.
CARSON. Where's Francis?
GUTHRIE. He ran the other way, towards Shimbu.
CARSON. Why?
GUTHRIE. I don't know. Maybe he knew something.
CARSON. My God. You were taking a hell of a chance, going in
after dark.
GUTHRIE. We were already six hours behind.
CARSON. Shimbu was a long shot anyway.
GUTHRIE. Not Shimbu. The Globe is a Sunday paper. If you miss it by an hour you've missed it by a week. Story could be dead as a—I mean —(To WAGNER.) he wanted to go in, Dick. It wasn't just me.
(WAGNER nods. CARSON touches RUTH's shoulder.)
CARSON. I've got to follow Mageeba to KC. There's nothing to worry about. He needs to talk to me about the mines, doesn't want to bomb the bits that matter. (To WAGNER.)
I'm taking the helicopter. I'll dump you two at the airport, but after that you're on your own. Get on any plane you can, and with luck you'll be out of the country before Mageeba has time to think about you. He's got bigger problems at the moment.
WAGNER. I want to file from here.
CARSON. I'm already sticking my neck out for you. You've got
time to get out and file.
WAGNER. No, I don't like that-planes can be late. Let me think.
GUTHRIE. You can file first from KC. Get an AP wire. You have to risk that. And then a plane. Gives you two chances.
WAGNER. Yes, that's good. Okay. What about Jake?
CARSON. There's no proper morgue in Jeddu. I'll take the body to KC. Do you know anything about his family? Who to tell?
WAGNER. Only the Globe. I'd better let them know that at least.
All right?
CARSON. You can try.
(WAGNER goes to the telex and switches it on, and taps some keys.)
We'll take the jeep down to the compound.
WAGNER. (Over his showder to GUTHRIE) Jeep picture?
(GUTHRIE pats his camera bag.)
GUTHRIE. I shot a couple of rolls before starting back. It was an artillery war when I left.
CARSON. (T WAGNER) If you can't get straight through you'll have to leave it.
WAGNER. All my stuff's at the hotel.
CARSON. Forget it.
WAGNER. And the car?
CARSON. I'll get it picked up some time.
GUTHRIE. It's my car. I want it.
(WAGNER leaves the telex and comes back to GUTHRIE.)
WAGNER. What do you mean?
(GUTHRIE is putting rolls of exposed film into linen envelopes which are pre-prepared, labelled.)
GUTHRIE. Here. The guy in the AP office is called Chamberlain.
Ask him to print up this one—I marked it-and wire anything which looks worthwhile. Tell him to push it to eight hundred and bugger the grain, I was using moonlight and flares. This one is for the London plane if you can get a pigeon.
CARSON. I don't think you understand. Mageeba is unpredictable.
He may decide he was amused by your effrontery and give you a decoration, or he may feed you to the crocodiles. If I were you I wouldn't take the chance. He can always post you the decoration.
GUTHRIE. No, I don't think so.
CARSON. Look first that Shimbu interview, and now you calling him names-he's not going to think the Globe is on his side.
GUTHRIE. We're not here to be on somebody's side, Geoffrey.
That was World War II. We try to show what happened, and what it was like. That's all we do. It's bloody difficult, and sometimes people bitch about which side we're supposed to be on. (To WAGNER.) Remember what that Yank admiral said to Malcolm Browne that time in Saigon? (To CARSON.)
This brass-hat showed up and he knew that all the bad news was just the fault of the reporters. He knew them by name.
He said to the AP man, 'Oh, so you're Browne. When are you going to get on the team?' (To WAGNER.) Remember that? The team. Give me the keys. I'll go by the hotel and get your stuff out.
(WAGNER hands over the car keys.)
WAGNER. Use my room. You should crash for a few hours.
GUTHRIE. No, I want to get back. It'll all be happening this
morning.
WAGNER. I'll see you then. Take care, George.
CARSON. Good luck, George.
RUTH. I hope they blow your head off, George.
CARSON. Come on, Ruth.
RUTH. No, I won't. (To GUTHRIE.) Tell me something, George.
Which page is it on?
GUTHRIE. What?
(The newspapers are still in the room and RUTH picks up one of them.)
RUTH. This thing that's worth dying for.
GUTHRIE. I don't intend to die for anything.
RUTH. Jake did.
GUTHRIE. Yes.
RUTH. (With the paper) Show me where it is. It can't be on the back page-Rain Halts Australian Collapse.' That's not it, is it? Or the woman's page Sexy Or Sexist?-The Case For Intimate Deodorants.' Is that it, George? What about readers' letters?-'Dear Sir, If the Prime Minister had to travel on the seven fifty-three from Bexhill every morning we'd soon have the railwaymen back on the lines.' Am I getting warm, George?
WAGNER. You're belittling his death.
RUTH. (Angrily) You bet I am. I'm not going to let you think he died for free speech and the guttering candle of democracy
—crap! You're all doing it to impress each other and be top dog the next time you're propping up a bar in Beirut or Bangkok, or Chancery Lane. Look at Dick and tell me I'm a liar. He's going to be a hero. The wires from London are going to burn up with congratulations. They'll be talking about Wagner's scoop for years, or anyway Wagner will. It's all bloody ego. And the winner isn't democracy, it's just business. As far as I'm concerned, Jake died for the product. He died for the women's page, and the crossword, and the racing results, and the heartbreak beauty queens and somewhere at the end of a long list I suppose he died for the leading article too, but it's never worth that— (She has started to swipe at GUTHRIE with a newspaper and she ends up flinging it at him.)
GUTHRIE. Yes, all that. But also the other thing. I've been around a lot of places. People do awful things to each other. But it's worse in places where everybody is kept in the dark. It really is. Information is light. Information, in itself, about anything, is light. That's all you can say, really. (To WAGNER.) What's the name of the hotel?
WAGNER. I forget. Green awnings.
CARSON. The Sandringham.
WAGNER. Oh yeah. I should have used that.
GUTHRIE. There'll always be an England, though maybe not
there. I'll see you.
(GUTHRIE goes.)
CARSON. Go to bed, darling. I'm sorry about having to go. T'll
bring Allie back anyway.
RUTH. Will it be all right for him here?
CARSON. Oh yes. If it's not, I don't want you here either. I'll have some news before I leave KC. (To WAGNER.) Fit?
(The telex has started chattering.)
If that's London make it quick. (To RUTH.) Do we have an old blanket or something like that?
RUTH. Just take anything.
(CARSON goes out. WAGNER has gone to the chattering telex. It doesn't chatter for long. WAGNER stands reading the message as it comes off the machine. The machine stops. WAGNER continues to stare at it for a few moments. Then he turns away and goes to his Cutty Sark bottle and pours himself a drink and then takes the drink back to his chair and sits down.)
London?
WAGNER. Yes.
RUTH. Well?
WAGNER. There's no hurry.
(CARSON comes back with a ground-sheet.)
CARSON. Allie's ground-sheet. I'll get him another one. (To WAGNER.) Okay—? What are you doing? (He's crossing to the telex.) Did you get it? (CARSON tears the message out of the machine and looks at it. He comes back into the room with it.) It's yours. From someone called Battersby. 'Milne copy blacked by subs, full chapel and machine room support.
Total confrontation and dismissal notices tonight, weekend shut down definite. Wotwu——is that a garble?—*Wotwu
—Battersby. What's that?
WAGNER. There's no paper this week.
(Pause)
CARSON. That's rotten luck, Dick.
(He gives WAGNER the telex message.)
WAGNER. Yeah. Wotwu.
CARSON. What is that?
WAGNER. Workers of the world unite.
CARSON. I see. What will you do now?
WAGNER. I'm just thinking. Would you air-freight George's film
for me? There's no rush.
(CARSON receives the envelopes from WAGNER, or just picks them up.)
CARSON. Yes, all right.
WAGNER. Telex the way-bill number to the office and they'll pick them up COD. I'll call the hotel and get George to come back and fetch me. There may be a paper next week, and as he says, it'll all be happening this morning. I ought to be there.
RUTH. Aren't you supposed to be withdrawing your labour?
WAGNER. (Snaps at her) Don't get clever with me, damn you.
(Pause. To CARSON.) I'm sorry.
RUTH. That's all right.
ARON. What about your story? Can't they do anything with it?
VAGNE. Yes, they could make paper aeroplanes with it. We'll see. Thanks for everything, Geoff.
CARSON. Drop by again.
WAGNER. I will.
CARSON. (To RUTH) I'll phone from KC.
(CARSON leaves. WAGNER empties his glass and stands up.)
WAGNER. Could I have another drink?
RUTH. You brought it. (She takes his glass.) I think I'll have one too. Nightcap.
(WAGNER goes to the telex and is tapping at it while she is pouring the rest of the Cutty Sark equally into two glasses.)
What are you doing?
WAGNER. Short piece about Jake. Onpass Grimsby Messenger.
RUTH. Good idea.
(The jeep is heard leaving.)
No point in staying sober now he's gone, eh?
WAGNER. Jake?
RUTH. The President.
WAGNER. Oh.
(She takes his drink and puts it on top of the telex.)
RUTH. Are you going to call George?
WAGNER. In a while. He won't be there yet. Did you have a
thing for Jake?
RUTH. No.
WAGNER. Just wondered.
(WAGNER is working the keyboard, pausing for thought. He stops to loosen his tie and light a cigarette. RUTH takes her drink back into the room.)
RUTH. Well, it was a very elevated, intellectual sort of thing. I wanted to undress him with my teeth. Oh God, I'm tired as hell and I'm not going to get to sleep.
WAGNER. Don't you have a pill for that?
RUTH. There are no pills for that. I want to be hammered out, disjointed, folded up and put away like linen in a drawer.
(She goes back to the whisky bottle and holds it upside down over her glass, and examines the label.) You can use the phone upstairs if you like.
WAGNER. I thought you didn't want to be a tart...
RUTH. How do I know until I've tried it? I name this bottle
'Cutty Sark'.
(She breaks the bottle against the marble shelf and drops the remainder into the bin. She looks at WAGNER. he's at the keyboard, tie loose, cigarette in mouth, whisky on the 'piano lid'. It looks like a familiar piano-player-plus singer scene. We hear the piano. Something fast. RUTH sings. Just a few bars.
WAGNER disrupts this by tearing the paper out of the machine.)
Is that it?
WAGNER. That's it.
(Blackout.)


ACT ONE
Two ELIZABETHANS passing the time in a place without any visible character.
They are well dressed— hats, cloaks, sticks and all.
Each of them has a large leather money bag.
GUILDENSTERN's bag is nearly empty.
ROSENCRANTZ's bag is nearly full.
The reason being: they are betting on the toss of a coin, in the following manner: GUILDENSTERN (hereafter 'GUIL') takes a coin out of his bag, spins it, letting it fall. ROSENCRANTZ (hereafter 'ROS') studies it, announces it as "heads" (as it happens) and puts it into his own bag. Then they repeat the process. They have apparently been doing this for some time.
The run of "heads" is impossible, yet Ros betrays no surprise at all-he feels none. However, he is nice enough to feel a little embarrassed at taking so much money off his friend. Let that be his character note.
GUIL is well alive to the oddity of it. He is not worried about the money, but he is worried by the implications; aware but not going to panic about it-his character note.
GUIL sits. ROs stands (he does the moving, retrieving coins).
GUIL spins. ROS studies coin.
ROS. Heads.
(He picks it up and puts it in his bag. The process is repeated.)
Heads.
(Again.)
ROS. Heads.
(Again.)
Heads.
(Again.)
Heads.
GUIL. (flipping a coin): There is an art to the building up of
suspense.
ROS. Heads.
GUIL. (flipping another): Though it can be done by luck alone.
ROS. Heads.
GUIL. If that's the word I'm after.
ROS. (raises his head at GUIL): Seventy-six love.
(GUIL gets up but has nowhere to go. He spins another coin over his shoulder without looking at it, his attention being directed at his environment or lack of it.
Heads.
GUIL. A weaker man might be moved to re-examine his faith, if in nothing else at least in the law of probability.
(He slips a coin over his shoulder as he goes to look upstage.)
ROS. Heads.
(GUIL, examining the confines of the stage, jips over two more coins as he does so, one by one of course. ROS announces each of them as "heads".)
GUIL. (musing): The law of probability, it has been oddly asserted, is something to do with the proposition that if six monkeys (he has surprised himself)... if six monkeys were...
ROS. Game?
GUIL. Were they?
ROS. Are you?
GUIL. (understanding): Game. (Flips a coin.) The law of averages, if I have got this right, means that if six monkeys were thrown up in the air for long enough they would land on their tails about as often as they would land on their-
ROS. Heads. (He picks up the coin.)
GUIL. Which even at first glance does not strike one as a particularly rewarding speculation, in either sense, even without the monkeys. I mean you wouldn't bet on it. I mean I would, but you wouldn't... (As he flips a coin.)
ROS. Heads.
GUIL. Would you? (Flips a coin.)
ROS. Heads.
(Repeat.)
Heads. (He looks up at GUIL-embarrassed laugh.) Getting a bit of a bore, isn't it?
GUIL. (coldly): A bore?
ROS. Well ...
GUIL. What about the suspense?
ROS. (innocently): What suspense?
(Small pause.)
GUIL. It must be the law of diminishing returns... I feel the spell about to be broken. (Energizing himself somewhat.)
(He takes out a coin, spins it high, catches it, turns it over on to the back of his other hand, studies the coin— and tosses it to ROS. His energy deflates and he sits.)
Well, it was an even chance... if my calculations are correct.
ROS. Eighty-five in a row—beaten the record!
GUIL. Don't be absurd.
ROS. Basily!
GUIL. (angry): Is that it, then? Is that all?
ROS. What?
GUIL. A new record? Is that as far as you are prepared to go?
ROS. Well...
GUIL. No questions? Not even a pause?
ROS. You spun them yourself.
GUIL. Not a flicker of doubt?
ROS. (aggrieved, aggressive): Well, I won-didn't I?
GUIL. (approaches him-
-quieter): And if you'd lost? If they'd
come down against you, eighty-five times, one after another, just like that?
ROS. (dumbly): Eighty-five in a row? Tails?
GUIL. Yes! What would you think?
ROS. (doubtfully): Well... (Jocularly.) Well, I'd have a good
look at your coins for a start!
GUIL. (retiring): I'm relieved. At least we can still count on self-interest as a predictable factor... I suppose it's the last to go. Your capacity for trust made me wonder if perhaps... you, alone... (He turns on him suddenly, reaches out a hand.) Touch.
(Ros clasps his hand. GUIL pulls him up to him.)
(More intensely): We have been spinning coins together since
- (He releases him almost as violently.) This is not the first time we have spun coins!
ROS. Oh no—we've been spinning coins for as long as I
remember.
GUIL. How long is that?
ROS. I forget. Mind you eighty-five times!
GUIL. Yes?
ROS. It'll take some beating, I imagine.
GUIL. Is that what you imagine? Is that it? No fear?
ROS. Fear?
GUIL. (in fury-
flings a coin on the ground): Fear! The crack that might flood your brain with light!
ROS. Heads... (He puts it in his bag.)
(GUIL sits despondently. He takes a coin, spins it, lets it fall between his feet. He looks at it, picks it up, throws it to ROS, who puts it in his bag.)
(GUIL takes another coin, spins it, catches it, turns it over on to his other hand, looks at it, and throws it to ROS who puts it in his bag.)
(GUIL takes a third coin, spins it, catches it in his right hand, turns it over on to his left wrist, lobs it in the air, catches it with his left hand, raises his left leg, throws the coin up under it, catches it and turns it over on to the top of his head, where it sits. Ros comes, looks at it, puts it in his bag.)
ROS. I'm afraid
GUIL. So am I.
ROS. I'm afraid it isn't your day.
GUIL. I'm afraid it is.
(Small pause.)
ROS. Eighty-nine.
GUIL. It must be indicative of something, besides the redistribution of wealth. (He muses.) List of possible explanations.
One: I'm willing it. Inside where nothing shows, I am the essence of a man spinning double-headed coins, and betting against himself in private atonement for an unremembered past. (He spins a coin at ROS.)
ROS. Heads.
GUIL. Two: time has stopped dead, and the single experience of one coin being spun once has been repeated ninety times...
(He flips a coin, looks at it, tosses it to ROS.) On the whole, doubtful. Three: divine intervention, that is to say, a good turn from above concerning him, cf. children of Israel, or retribution from above concerning me, cf. Lot's wife. Four: a spectacular vindication of the principle that each individual coin spun individually (he spins one) is as likely to come down heads as tails and therefore should cause no surprise each individual time it does. (It does. He tosses it to ROS.)
ROS. I've never known anything like it!
GUIL. And a syllogism: One, he has never known anything like it. Two, he has never known anything to write home about.
Three, it is nothing to write home about... Home...
What's the first thing you remember?
ROS. Oh, let's see... The first thing that comes into my head,
you mean?
GUIL. No- the first thing you remember.
ROS. Ah. (Pause.) No, it's no good, it's gone. It was a long time
ago.
GUIL. (patient but edged): You don't get my meaning. What is the first thing after all the things you've forgotten?
ROS. Oh I see. (Pause.) I've forgotten the question.
GUIL. How long have you suffered from a bad memory?
ROS. I can't remember.
(GUIL paces.)
GUIL. Are you happy?
ROS. What?
GUIL. Content? At ease?
ROS. I suppose so.
GUIL. What are you going to do now?
ROS. I don't know. What do you want to do?
GUIL. I have no desires. None. (He stops pacing dead.) There was a messenger. . that's right. We were sent for. (He wheels at Ros and raps out—) Syllogism the second: one, probability is a factor which operates within natural forces. Two, probability is not operating as a factor. Three, we are now within un-, sub- or supernatural forces. Discuss. (ROS is suitably startled- Acidly.) Not too heatedly.
ROS. I'm sorry I-What's the matter with you?
GUIL. The scientific approach to the examination of phenomena is a defence against the pure emotion of fear.
Keep tight hold and continue while there's time. Now counter to the previous syllogism: tricky one, follow me carefully, it may prove a comfort. If we postulate, and we just have, that within un-, sub- or supernatural forces the probability is that the law of probability will not operate as a factor, then we must accept that the probability of the first part will not operate as a factor, in which case the law of probability will operate as a factor within un-, sub- or supernatural forces. And since it obviously hasn't been doing so, we can take it that we are not held within un-, sub-or supernatural forces after all; in all probability, that is.
Which is a great relief to me personally. (Small pause.)
Which is all very well, except that-
- (He continues with tight hysteria, under control.) We have been spinning coins together since I don't know when, and in all that time if it is all that time) I don't suppose either of us was more than a couple of gold pieces up or down. I hope that doesn't sound surprising because it's very unsurprisingness is something I am trying to keep hold of. The equanimity of your average pitcher and tosser of coins depends upon a law, or rather a tendency, or let us say a probability, or at any rate a mathematically calculable chance, which ensures that he will not upset himself by losing too much nor upset his opponent by winning too often. This made for a kind of harmony and a kind of confidence. It related the fortuitous and the ordained into a reassuring union which we recognized as nature. The sun came up about as often as it went down, in the long run, and a coin showed heads about as often as it showed tails. Then a messenger arrived. We had been sent for. Nothing else happened. Ninety-two coins spun consecutively have come down heads ninety-two consecutive times... and for the last three minutes on the wind of a windless day I have heard the sound of drums and flute...
ROS. (cutting his fingernails): Another curious scientific phenomenon is the fact that the fingernails grow after death, as does the beard.
GUIL. What?
ROS. (loud): Beard!
GUIL. But you're not dead.
ROS. (irritated): I didn't say they started to grow after death!
(Pause, calmer.) The fingernails also grow before birth, though not the beard.
GUIL. What?
ROS. (shouts): Beard! What's the matter with you? (Reflectively.)
The toenails, on the other hand never grow at all.
GUIL. (bemused): The toenails never grow at all?
ROS. Do they? It's a funny thing—I cut my fingernails all the time, and every time I think to cut them, they need cutting Now, for instance. And yet, I never, to the best of my knowledge, cut my toenails. They ought to be curled under my feet by now, but it doesn't happen. I never think about them. Perhaps I cut them absent-mindedly, when I'm thinking of something else.
GUIL. (tensed up by this rambling): Do you remember the first
thing that happened today?
ROS. (promptly): I woke up, I suppose. (Triggered.) Oh-I've got it now-that man, a foreigner, he woke us up
GUIL. A messenger. (He relaxes, sits.)
ROS. That's it-pale sky before dawn, a man standing on his saddle to bang on the shutters- shouts-What's all the row about?! Clear off!-But then he called our names. You remember that this man woke us up.
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. We were sent for.
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. That's why we're here. (He looks round, seems doubtful,
then the explanation.) Travelling.
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. (dramatically): It was urgent—a matter of extreme urgency, a royal summons, his very words: official business and no questions asked-lights in the stable-yard, saddle up and off headlong and hotfoot across the land, our guides outstripped in breakneck pursuit of our duty! Fearful lest we come too late!!
(Small pause.)
GUIL. Too late for what?
ROS. How do I know? We haven't got there yet.
GUIL. Then what are we doing here, I ask myself.
ROS. You might well ask.
GUIL. We better get on.
ROS. You might well think.
GUIL. Without much conviction; we better get on.
ROS. (actively): Right! (Pause.) On where?
GUIL. Forward.
ROS. (forward to footlights): Ah. (Hesitates.) Which way do
we—(He turns round.) Which way did we—?
GUIL. Practically starting from scratch... An awakening, a man standing on his saddle to bang on the shutters, our names shouted in a certain dawn, a message, a summons...
A new record for pitch and toss.
We have not been …
picked out ... simply to be abandoned... set loose to find our own way... We are entitled to some direction ... I would have thought.
ROS. (alert, listening): I say—! I say—
GUIL. Yes?
ROS. I can hear—I thought I heard-music.
(GUIL raises himself.)
GUIL. Yes?
ROS. Like a band. (He looks around, laughs embarrassedly, expiating himself.) It sounded like—a band. Drums.
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. (relaxes): It couldn't have been real.
GUIL. "The colours red, blue and green are real. The colour yellow is a mystical experience shared by everybody" — demolish.
ROS. (at edge of stage): It must have been thunder. Like drums ...
(By the end of the next speech, the band is faintly audible.)
GUIL. A man breaking his journey between one place and another at a third place of no name, character, population or significance, sees a unicorn cross his path and disappear.
That in itself is startling, but there are precedents for mystical encounters of various kinds, or to be less extreme, a choice of persuasions to put it down to fancy; until —
"My God," says a second man, "I must be dreaming, I thought I saw a unicorn." At which point, a dimension is added that makes the experience as alarming as it will ever be. A third witness, you understand, adds no further dimension but only spreads it thinner, and a fourth thinner still, and the more witnesses there are the thinner it gets and the more reasonable it becomes until it is as thin as reality, the name we give to the common experience... "Look, look!" recites the crowd. "A horse with an arrow in its forehead! It must have been mistaken for a deer."
ROS. (eagerly): I knew all along it was a band.
GUIL. (tiredly): He knew all along it was a band.
ROS. Here they come!
GUIL. (at the last moment before they enter-wistfully): I'm sorry it wasn't a unicorn. It would have been nice to have unicorns.
(The TRAGEDIANS are six in number, including a small BOY (ALFRED). Two pull and push a cart piled with props and belongings. There is also a DRUMMER, a HORN-PLAYER and a FLAUTIST. The SPOKESMAN ("the PLAYER") has no instrument.
He brings up the rear and is the first to notice them.)
PLAYER. Halt!
(The GROUP turns and halts.)
(Joyously.) An audience!
(Ros and GUIL half rise.)
Don't move!
(They sink back. He regards them fondly.)
Perfect! A lucky thing we came along.
ROS. For us?
PLAYER. Let us hope so. But to meet two gentlemen on the road—we would not hope to meet them off it.
ROS. No?
PLAYER. Well met, in fact, and just in time.
ROS. Why's that?
PLAYER. Why, we grow rusty and you catch us at the very point of decadence by this time tomorrow we might have forgotten everything we ever knew. That's a thought, isn't it? (He laughs generously.) We'd be back where we started improvising.
ROS. Tumblers, are you?
PLAYER. We can give you a tumble if that's your taste, and times being what they are... Otherwise, for a jingle of coin we can do you a selection of gory romances, full of fine cadence and corpses, pirated from the Italian; and it doesn't take much to make a jingle even a single coin has music in it.
(They ALL flourish and bow, raggedly.)
Tragedians, at your command.
(Ros and GUIL have got to their feet.)
ROS. My name is Guildenstern, and this is Rosencrantz.
(GUIL confers briefly with him.)
(Without embarrassment.) I'm sorry—his name's
Guildenstern, and I'm Rosencrantz.
PLAYER. A pleasure. We've played to bigger, of course, but quality counts for something. I recognized you at once
ROS. And who are we?
PLAYER. — as fellow artists.
ROS. I thought we were gentlemen.
PLAYER. For some of us it is performance, for others, patronage.
They are two sides of the same coin, or, let us say, being as there are so many of us, the same side of two coins. (Bows again.) Don't clap too loudly-it's a very old world.
ROS. What is your line?
PLAYER. Tragedy, sir. Deaths and disclosures, universal and particular, denouements both unexpected and inexorable, transvestite melodrama on all levels including the suggestive.
We transport you into a world of intrigue and illusion ... clowns, if you like, murderers— we can do you ghosts and battles, on the skirmish level, heroes, villians, tormented lovers- set pieces in the poetic vein; we can do you rapiers or rape or both, by all means, faithless wives and ravished virgins-flagrante delicto at a price, but that comes under realism for which there are special terms. Getting warm, am I?
ROS. (doubtfully): Well, I don't know… 
PLAYER. It costs little to watch, and little more if you happen to get caught up in the action, if that's your taste and times being what they are.
ROS. What are they?
PLAYER. Indifferent.
ROS. Bad?
PLAYER. Wicked. Now what precisely is your pleasure? (He turns to the TRAGEDIANS.) Gentlemen, disport yourselves.
(The TRAGEDIANS shuffle into some kind of line.)
There! See anything you like?
ROS. (doubtful, innocent): What do they do?
PLAYER. Let your imagination run riot. They are beyond
surprise.
ROS. And how much?
PLAYER. To take part?
ROS. To watch.
PLAYER. Watch what?
ROS. A private performance.
SPLAYER. How private?
UROS. Well, there are only two of us. Is that enough?
PLAYER. For an audience, disappointing. For voyeurs, about
average.
ROS. What's the difference?
PLAYER. Ten guilders.
ROS. (horrified): Ten guilders!
PLAYER. I mean eight.
ROS. Together?
PLAYER. Each. I don't think you understand—
ROS. What are you saying?
PLAYER. What am I saying
-seven.
ROS. Where have you been?
PLAYER. Roundabout. A nest of children carries the custom of the town. Juvenile companies, they are the fashion. But they cannot match our repertoire... we'll stoop to anything if that's your bent..
(He regards Ros meaningfully but Ros returns the stare blankly.)
ROS. They'll grow up.
PLAYER. (giving up): There's one born every minute. (To
TRAGEDIANS.) On-ward!
(The TRAGEDIANS start to resume their burdens and their journey. GUIL stirs himself at last.)
GUIL. Where are you going?
PLAYER. Ha-alt!
(They halt and turn.)
Home, sir.
GUIL. Where from?
PLAYER. Home. We're travelling people. We take our chances
where we find them.
GUIL. It was chance, then?
PLAYER. Chance?
GUIL. You found us.
PLAYER. Oh yes.
GUIL. You were looking?
PLAYER. Oh no.
GUIL. Chance, then.
PLAYER. Or fate.
GUIL. Yours or ours?
PLAYER. It could hardly be one without the other.
GUIL. Fate, then.
PLAYER. Oh yes. We have no control. Tonight we play to the court. Or the night after. Or to the tavern. Or not.
GUIL. Perhaps I can use my influence.
PLAYER. At the tavern?
GUIL. At the court. I would say I have some influence.
PLAYER. Would you say so?
GUIL. I have influence yet.
PLAYER. Yet what?
(GUIL seizes the PLAYER violently.)
GUIL. I have influence!
(The PLAYER does not resist. GUIL loosens his hold.)
(More calmly.) You said something about getting caught up in the action
PLAYER. (gaily freeing himself): I did!-I did!-You're quicker than your friend... (Confidingly.) Now for a handful of guilders I happen to have a private and uncut performance of the Rape of the Sabine Women or rather woman, or rather Alfred —(Over his shoulder.) Get your skirt on, Alfred
(The Boy starts struggling into a female robe.) ... and for eight you can participate.
(GUIL backs, PLAYER follows.)
.. taking either part.
(GUIL backs.)
... or both for ten.
(GUIL tries to turn away, PLAYER holds his sleeve.)
..with encores
(GUIL smashes the PLAYER across the face. The PLAYER recoils. GUIL stands trembling.)
(Resigned and quiet). Get your skirt off, Alfred...
(ALFRED struggles out of his half-on robe.)
GUIL. (shaking with rage and fright): It could have been—it didn't have to be obscene... It could have been—a bird out of season, dropping bright-feathered on my shoulder... It could have been a tongueless dwarf standing by the road to point the way... I was prepared. But it's this, is it? No enigma, no dignity, nothing classical, portentous, only this
—a comic pornographer and a rabble of prostitutes...
PLAYER. (acknowledging the description with a sweep of his hat, bowing: sadly): You should have caught us in better times.
We were purists then. (Straightens up.) On-ward.
(The PLAYERS make to leave.)
ROS. (his voice has changed: he has caught on): Excuse me!
PLAYER. Ha-alt!
(They halt.)
A-al-1-fred!
(ALFRED resumes the struggle. The PLAYER comes forward.)
ROS. You're not—ah— exclusively players, then?
PLAYER. We're inclusively players, sir.
ROS. So you give exhibitions?
PLAYER. Performances, sir.
ROS. Yes, of course. There's more money in that, is there?
PLAYER. There's more trade, sir.
ROS. Times being what they are.
PLAYER. Yes.
ROS. Indifferent.
PLAYER. Completely.
ROS. You know I'd no idea
PLAYER. No
ROS. I mean, I've heard of —but I've never actually
PLAYER. No.
ROS. I mean, what exactly do you do?
PLAYER. We keep to our usual stuff, more or less, only inside out. We do on stage the things that are supposed to happen off. Which is a kind of integrity, if you look on every exit being an entrance somewhere else.
ROS. (nervy, loud): Well, I'm not really the type of man who-no, but don't hurry off—sit down and tell us about some of the things people ask you to do-(The PLAYER turns away.)
PLAYER. On-ward!
ROS. Just a minute!
(They turn and look at him without expression.)
Well, all right—I wouldn't mind seeing- just an idea of the kind of-
(bravely). What will you do for that? (And tosses a single coin on the ground between them.)
(The PLAYER spits at the coin, from where he stands.)
PLAYER. (to ROS, coldly): Leave it lying there. Perhaps when we come back this way we'll be that much cheaper.
(The TRAGEDIANs demur, trying to get at the coin. He kicks and cuffs them back.)
On!
(ALFRED is still half in and out of his robe. The PLAYER cuffs him.)
(To ALFRED.) What are you playing at?
(RoS is shamed into fury.)
ROS. Filth! Disgusting oh, I know the kind of filth you trade in—I'll report you to the authorities perverts! I know your game all right, it's all filth!
(The PLAYERS are about to leave. GUIL has remained detached.)
GUIL. (casually): Do you like a bet?
PLAYER. Ha-alt!
(The TRAGEDIANS look interested. The PLAYER comes forward.)
PLAYER. What kind of bet did you have in mind?
(GUIL walks half the distance towards the PLAYER, stops with his foot over the coin.)
GUIL. Double or quits.
PLAYER. Well... heads.
(GUIL raises his foot. The PLAYER bends. The TRAGEDIANS crowd round. Relief and congratulations. The PLAYER picks up the coin. GUIL throws him a second coin.)
GUIL. Again?
(Some of the TRAGEDIANs are for it, others against. The PLAYER nods and tosses the coin.)
GUIL. Heads.
(It is. He picks it up.)
Again.
(GUIL spins coin.)
PLAYER. Heads.
(It is. PLAYER picks up coin. He has two coins again. He spins one.)
GUIL. Heads.
(It is. GUIL picks it up. Then tosses it immediately.)
PLAYER. (fractional hesitation): Tails.
(But it's heads. GUIL picks it up. PLAYER tosses down his last coin by way of paying up, and turns away. GUIL doesn't pick it up; he puts his foot on it.)
GUIL. Heads.
PLAYER. No!
(Pause. The TRAGEDIANS are against this.)
(Apologetically.) They don't like the odds.
GUIL. Äfter six heads in a row? I'd say they were in your favour.
PLAYER. No.
GUIL lifts his foot, squats; picks up the coin still squatting; looks up): You were right-heads. (Spins it, slaps his hand on it, on the floor.) Heads I win.
PLAYER. No.
GUIL. (uncovers coin): Right again. (Repeat.) Heads I win.
PLAYER. No.
GUIL. (uncovers coin): And right again. (Repeat.) Heads I win.
PLAYER. No!
(He turns away, the TRAGEDIANS with him. GUIL stands up, comes close.)
GUIL. Would you believe it? (Stands back, relaxes, smiles.) Bet me the year of my birth doubled is an odd number.
PLAYER. Your birth
GUIL. If you don't trust me don't bet with me.
PLAYER. Would you trust me?
GUIL. Bet me then.
PLAYER. My birth?
GUIL. Odd numbers you win.
PLAYER. You're on-
(The TRAGEDIANS have come forward, wide awake.)
GUIL. Good. Year of your birth. Double it. Even numbers I
win, odd numbers I lose.
(Silence. An awful sigh as the TRAGEDIANS realize that any number doubled is even. Then a terrible row as they object.
Then a terrible silence.)
PLAYER. We have no money.
(GUIL turns to him.)
GUIL. Ah. Then what have you got?
(The PLAYER silently brings ALFRED forward. GUIL regards
ALFRED sadly.)
Was it for this?
PLAYER. It's the best we've got.
GUIL. (looking up and around): Then the times are bad indeed.
(The PLAYER starts to speak, protestation, but GUIL turns on him viciously.)
The very air stinks.
(The PLAYER moves back. GUIL moves down to the footlights and turns.)
Come here, Alfred.
(ALFRED moves down and stands, frightened and small.)
(Gently.) Do you lose often?
ALFRED. Yes, sir.
GUIL. Then what could you have left to lose?
ALFRED. Nothing, sir.
(Pause. GUIL regards him.)
GUIL. Do you like being ... an actor?
ALFRED. No, sir.
(GUIL looks around, at the audience.)
GUIL. You and I, Alfred —we could create a dramatic precedent
here.
(And ALFRED, who has been near tears, starts to sniffle.)
Come, come, Alfred, this is no way to fill the theatres of Europe.
(The PLAYER has moved down, to remonstrate with ALFRED.
GUIL cuts him off again.)
(Viciously.) Do you know any good plays?
PLAYER. Plays?
ROS. (coming forward, faltering shyly): Exhibitions...
GUIL. I thought you said you were actors.
PLAYER. (dawning): Oh. Oh well, we are. We are. But there hasn't
been much call-
GUIL. You lost. Well then-one of the Greeks, perhaps? You're familiar with the tragedies of antiquity, are you? The great homicidal classics? Matri, patri, fratri, sorrori, uxori and it goes without saying
ROS. Saucy-
GUIL.-
-Suicidal-hm? Maidens aspiring to godheads
ROS. And vice versa
GUIL. Your kind of thing, is it?
PLAYER. Well, no, I can't say it is, really. We're more of the
blood, love and rhetoric school.
GUIL. Well, I'll leave the choice to you, if there is anything to
choose between them.
PLAYER. They're hardly divisible, sir—-well, I can do you blood and love without the rhetoric, and I can do you blood and rhetoric without the love, and I can do you all three concurrent or consecutive, but I can't do you love and rhetoric without the blood. Blood is compulsory-they're all blood, you see.
GUIL. Is that what people want?
PLAYER. It's what we do. (Small pause. He turns away.)
(GUIL touches ALFRED on the shoulder.)
GUIL. (wry, gentle): Thank you; we'll let you know.
(The PLAYER has moved upstage. ALFRED follows.)
PLAYER. (to TRAGEDIANS): Thirty-eight!
ROS. (moving across, fascinated and hopeful): Position?
PLAYER. Sir?
ROS. One of your—tableaux?
PLAYER. No, sir.
ROS. Oh.
PLAYER. (to the TRAGEDIANS, now departing with their cart, already taking various props off it): Entrances there and there (indicating upstage).
(The PLAYER has not moved his position for his last four lines. He does not move now. GUIL waits.)
GUIL. Well... aren't you going to change into your costume?
PLAYER. I never change out of it, sir.
GUIL. Always in character.
PLAYER. That's it.
(Pause.)
GUIL. Aren't you going to come on?
PLAYER. I am on.
GUIL. But if you are on, you can't come on. Can you?
PLAYER. I start on.
GUIL. But it hasn't started. Go on. We'll look out for you.
PLAYER. I'll give you a wave.
(He does not move. His immobility is now pointed, and getting awkward. Pause. Ros walks up to him till they are face to face.)
ROS. Excuse me.
(Pause. The PLAYER lifts his downstage foot. It was covering GUIL's coin. Ros puts his foot on the coin. Smiles.)
Thank you.
(The PLAYER turns and goes. ROS has bent for the coin.)
GUIL. (moving out): Come on.
ROS. I say—that was lucky.
GUIL. (turning): What?
ROS. It was tails.
(He tosses the coin to GUIL who catches it. Simultaneously— a lighting change sufficient to alter the exterior mood into interior, but nothing violent.)
And OPHELIA runs on in some alarm, holding up her skirts followed by HAMLET.
Note: The resemblance between HAMLET and the PLAYER is superficial but noticeable.
(OPHELIA has been sewing and she holds the garment. They are both mute. HAMLET, with his doublet all unbraced, no hat upon his head, his stockings fouled, ungartered and down-gyved to his ankle, pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other... and with a look so piteous, he takes her by the wrist and holds her hard, then he goes to the length of his arm, and with his other hand over his brow, falls to such perusal of her face as he would draw it... At last, with a little shaking of his arm, and thrice his head waving up and down, he raises a sigh so piteous and profound that it does seem to shatter all his bulk and end his being. That done he lets her go, and with his head over his shoulder turned, he goes out backwards without taking his eyes off her... she runs off in the opposite direction.)
(Ros and GUIL have frozen. GUIL unfreezes first. He jumps at ROS.)
GUIL. Come on!
(But a flourish-enter CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE, attended.)
CLAUDIUS: Welcome, dear Rosencrantz... (he raises a hand at GUIL while ROs bows—GUIL bows late and hurriedly) ... and Guildenstern.
(He raises a hand at Ros while GUIL bows to him—Ros is still straightening up from his previous bow and half way up he bows down again. With his head down, he twists to look at GUIL, who is on the way up.)
Moreover that we did much long to see you, the need we have to use you did provoke our hasty sending.
(Ros and GUIL still adjusting their clothing for CLAUDIUS'S presence.)
Something have you heard
Of Hamlet's transformation, so call it, Sith nor th'exterior nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should be, More than his father's death, that thus hath put him, So much from th'understanding of himself, I cannot dream of. I entreat you both
That, being of so young days brought up with him And sith so neighboured to his youth and haviour That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court Some little time, so by your companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from occasion you may glean, Whether aught to us unknown afflicts him thus, That opened lies within our remedy.
GERTRUDE: Good (fractional suspense) gentlemen...
(They both bow.)
He hath much talked of you,
And sure I am, two men there is not living To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To show us so much gentry and goodwill As to expand your time with us awhile For the supply and profit of our hope, Your visitation shall receive such thanks
As fits a king's remembrance.
ROS. Both your majesties
Might, by the sovereign power you have of us, Put your dread pleasures more into command Than to entreaty.
GUIL. But we both obey,
And here give up ourselves in the full bent
To lay our service freely at your feet, To be commanded.
CLAUDIUS: Thanks, Rosencrantz (turning to ROS who is caught unprepared, while GUIL bows) and gentle Guildenstern (turning to GUIL who is bent double).
GERTRUDE (correcting): Thanks Guildenstern (turning to ROS, who bows as GUIL checks upward movement to bow too both bent double, squinting at each other) ... and gentle Rosencrantz. (Turning to GUIL, both straightening up - GUIL checks again and bows again.)
And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed son. Go, some of you, And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
(Two ATTENDANTS exit backwards, indicating that Ros and GUIL should follow.)
GUIL. Heaven make our presence and our practices
Pleasant and helpful to him.
GERTRUDE: Ay, amen!
(Ros and GUIL move towards a downstage wing. Before they get there, POLONIUS enters. They stop and bow to him. He nods and hurries upstage to CLAUDIUS. They turn to look at him but lose interest and come down to the footlights.
POLONIUS meanwhile calling to CLAUDIUS.)
POLONIUS: The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, are
joyfully returned.
CLAUDIUS: Thou still hast been the father of good news.
POLONIUS: Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege,
I hold my duty as I hold my soul, Both to my God and to my gracious King;
And I do think, or else this brain of mine Hunts not the trail of policy so sure As it hath used to do, that I have found The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy...
(Exeunt—leaving ROS and GUIL.)
ROS. I want to go home.
GUIL. Don't let them confuse you.
ROS. I'm out ỏf my stép here-
GUIL. We'll soon be home and high-dry and home-T'll-ROS. It's all over my depth-GUIL. —I'll hie you home and
ROS. —out of my head
GUIL. —dry you high and-
ROS. (cracking, high): -
-over my step over my head body! —I
tell you it's all stopping to a death, it's boding to a depth, stepping to a head, it's all heading to a dead stop
GUIL. (the nursemaid): There! ... and we'll soon be home and dry ... and high and dry... (Rapidly.) Has it ever happened to you that all of a sudden and for no reason at all you haven't the faintest idea how to spell the word
"wife" —or "house"-because when you write it down you just can't remember ever having seen those letters in that order before... ?
ROS. I remember-GUIL. Yes?
ROS. I remember when there were no questions.
GUIL. There were always questions. To exchange one set for
another is no great matter.
ROS. Answers, yes. There were answers to everything.
GUIL. You've forgotten.
ROS. (faring): I haven't forgotten-how I used to remember my own name and yours, oh yes! There were answers everywhere you looked. There was no question about it-people knew who I was and if they didn't they asked and I told them.
GUIL. You did, the trouble is, each of them is ... plausible, without being instinctive. All your life you live so close to truth, it becomes a permanent blur in the corner of your eye, and when something nudges it into outline it is like being ambushed by a grotesque. A man standing in his saddle in the half-lit half-alive dawn banged on the shutters and called two names. He was just a hat and a cloak levitating in the grey plume of his own breath, but when he called we came. That much is certain—we came.
ROS. Well I can tell you I'm sick to death of it. I don't care one way or another, so why don't you make up your mind.
GUIL. We can't afford anything quite so arbitrary. Nor did we come all this way for a christening. All that—-preceded us.
But we are comparatively fortunate; we might have been left to sift the whole field of human nomenclature, like two blind men looting a bazaar for their own portraits... At least we are presented with alternatives.
ROS. Well as from now-
- GUIL. —But not choice.
ROS. You made me look ridiculous in there.
GUIL. I looked just as ridiculous as you did.
ROS. (an anguished cry): Consistency is all I ask!
GUIL. (low, wry rhetoric): Give us this day our daily mask.
ROS. (a dying fall): I want to go home. (Moves.) Which way did we come in? I've lost my sense of direction.
GUIL. The only beginning is birth and the only end is death-if you can't count on that, what can you count on?
(They connect again.)
ROS. We don't owe anything to anyone.
GUIL. We've been caught up. Your smallest action sets off another somewhere else, and is set off by it. Keep an eye open, an ear cocked. Tread warily, follow instructions.
We'll be all right.
ROS. For how long?
GUIL. Till events have played themselves out. There's a logic at work—it's all done for you, don't worry. Enjoy it. Relax.
To be taken in hand and led, like being a child again, even without the innocence, a child-It's like being given a prize, an extra slice of childhood when you least expect it,
as a
prize for being good, or compensation for never having had one... Do I contradict myself?
ROS. I can't remember... What have we got to go on?
GUIL. We have been briefed. Hamlet's transformation. What do
you recollect?
ROS. Well, he's changed, hasn't he? The exterior and inward
man fails to resemble-
GUIL. Draw him on to pleasures glean what afflicts him.
ROS. Something more than his father's death
GUIL. He's always talking about us there aren't two people
living whom he dotes on more than us.
ROS. We cheer him up find out what's the matter-GUIL. Exactly, it's a matter of asking the right questions and giving away as little as we can. It's a game.
ROS. And then we can go?
GUIL. And receive such thanks as fits a king's remembrance.
ROS. I like the sound of that. What do you think he means by
remembrance?
GUIL. He doesn't forget his friends.
ROS. Would you care to estimate?
GUIL. Difficult to say, really- some kings tend to be amnesiac, others I suppose-the opposite, whatever that is.
ROS. Yes-but-
GUIL. Elephantine.
?
ROS. Not how long—how much?
GUIL. Retentive-he's a very retentive king, a royal retainer.
ROS. What are you playing at ?
GUIL. Words, words. They're all we have to go on.
(Pause.)
ROS. Shouldn't we be doing something constructive?
GUIL. What did you have in mind? ... A short, blunt human
pyramid... ?
ROS. We could go.
GUIL. Where?
ROS. After him.
GUIL. Why? They've got us placed now-if we start moving around, we'll all be chasing each other all night.
(Hiatus.)
ROS. (at footlights): How very intriguing! (Turns.) I feel like a spectator-an appalling business. The only thing that makes it bearable is the irrational belief that somebody interesting will come on in a minute...
GUIL. See anyone?
ROS. No. You?
GUIL. No. (At footlights.) What a fine persecution-to be kept intrigued without ever quite being enlightened... (Pause.)
We've had no practice.
ROS. We could play at questions.
GUIL. What good would that do?
ROS. Practice!
GUIL. Statement! One-love.
ROS. Cheating!
GUIL. How?
ROS. I hadn't started yet.
GUIL. Statement. Two-love.
ROS. Are you counting that?
GUIL. What?
ROS. Are you counting that?
GUIL. Foul! No repetitions. Three-love. First game to…
ROS. I'm not going to play if you're going to be like that.
GUIL. Whose serve?
ROS. Hah?
GUIL. Foul! No grunts. Love
—one.
ROS. Whose go?
GUIL. Why?
ROS. Why not?
GUIL. What for?
ROS. Foul! No synonyms! One—all.
GUIL. What in God's name is going on?
ROS. Foul! No rhetoric. Two-one.
GUIL. What does it all add up to?
ROS. Can't you guess?
GUIL. Were you addressing me?
ROS. Is there anyone else?
GUIL. Who?
ROS. How would I know?
GUIL. Why do you ask?
ROS. Are you serious?
GUIL. Was that rhetoric?
ROS. No.
GUIL. Statement! Two-all. Game point.
ROS. What's the matter with you today?
GUIL. When?
ROS. What?
GUIL. Are you deaf?
ROS. Am I dead?
GUIL. Yes or no?
ROS. Is there a choice?
GUIL. Is there a God?
ROS. Foul! No non sequiturs, three-two, one game all.
GUIL. (seriously): What's your name?
ROS. What's yours?
GUIL. I asked you first.
ROS. Statement. One-love.
GUIL. What's your name when you're at home?
ROS. What's yours?
GUIL. When I'm at home?
ROS. Is it different at home?
GUIL. What home?
ROS. Haven't you got one?
GUIL. Why do you ask?
ROS. What are you driving at ?
GUIL. (with emphasis): What's your name ?!
ROS. Repetition. Twolove. Match point to me.
GUIL. (seizing him violently): WHO DO YOU THINK YOU
ARE?
ROS. Rhetoric! Game and match! (Pause.) Where's it going to end?
GUIL. That's the question.
ROS. It's all questions.
GUIL. Do you think it matters?
ROS. Doesn't it matter to you?
GUIL. Why should it matter?
ROS. What does it matter why?
GUIL. (teasing gently): Doesn't it matter why it matters?
ROS. (rounding on him): What's the matter with you?
(Pause.)
GUIL. It doesn't matter.
ROS. (voice in the wilderness): ... What's the game?
GUIL. What are the rules?
(Enter HAMLET behind, crossing the stage, reading a book-as he is about to disappear GUIL notices him.)
GUIL. (sharply): Rosencrantz!
ROS. (jumps): What!
(HAMLET goes. Triumph dawns on them, they smile.)
GUIL. There! How was that?
ROS. Clever!
GUIL. Natural?
ROS. Instinctive.
GUIL. Got it in your head?
ROS. I take my hat off to you.
GUIL. Shake hands.
(They do.)
ROS. Now I'll try you-Guil—!
GUIL. —Not yet-catch me unawares.
ROS. Right. (They separate. Pause. Aside to GUIL.) Ready?
GUIL. (explodes): Don't be stupid.
ROS. Sorry.
(Pause.)
GUIL. (snaps): Guildenstern!
ROS. (jumps): What? (He is immediately crestfallen, GUIL is
disgusted.)
GUIL. Consistency is all I ask!
ROS. (quietly): Immortality is all I seek...
GUIL dying fall): Give us this day our daily week...
(Beat.)
ROS. Who was that?
GUIL. Didn't you know him?
ROS. He didn't know me.
GUIL. He didn't see you.
ROS. I didn't see him.
GUIL. We shall see. I hardly knew him, he's changed.
ROS. You could see that?
GUIL. Transformed.
ROS. How do you know?
GUIL. Inside and out.
ROS. I see.
GUIL. He's not himself.
ROS. He's changed.
GUIL. I could see that. (Beat.) Glean what afflicts him.
ROS. Me?
GUIL. Him.
ROS. How?
GUIL. Question and answer. Old ways are the best ways.
ROS. He's afflicted.
GUIL. You question, I'll answer.
ROS. He's not himself, you know.
GUIL. I'm him, you see.
(Beat.)
ROS. Who am I then?
GUIL. You're yourself.
ROS. And he's you?
GUIL. Not a bit of it.
ROS. Are you afflicted?
GUIL. That's the idea. Are you ready?
ROS. Let's go back a bit.
GUIL. I'm afflicted.
ROS. I see.
GUIL. Glean what afflicts me.
ROS. Right.
GUIL. Question and answer.
ROS. How should I begin?
GUIL. Address me.
ROS. My dear Guildenstern!
GUIL. (quietly): You've forgotten—haven't you?
ROS. My dear Rosencrantz!
GUIL. (great control): I don't think you quite understand. What we are attempting is a hypothesis in which I answer for him, while you ask me questions.
ROS. Ah! Ready?
GUIL. You know what to do?
ROS. What?
GUIL. Are you stupid?
ROS. Pardon?
GUIL. Are you deaf?
ROS. Did you speak?
GUIL. (admonishing): Not now
ROS. Statement.
GUIL. (shouts): Not now! (Pause.) If I had any doubts, or rather hopes, they are dispelled. What could we possibly have in common except our situation? (They separate and sit.)
Perhaps he'll come back this way.
ROS. Should we go?
GUIL. Why?
(Pause.)
ROS. (starts up. Snaps fingers): Oh! You mean—you pretend to
be him, and I ask you questions!
GUIL. (dry): Very good.
ROS. You had me confused.
GUIL. I could see I had.
ROS. How should I begin?
GUIL. Address me.
(They stand and face each other, posing.)
ROS. My honoured Lord!
GUIL. My dear Rosencrantz!
(Pause.)
ROS. Am I pretending to be you, then?
GUIL. Certainly not. If you like. Shall we continue?
ROS. Question and answer.
GUIL. Right.
ROS. Right. My honoured lord!
GUIL. My dear fellow!
ROS. How are you?
GUIL. Afflicted!
ROS. Really? In what way?
GUIL. Transformed.
ROS. Inside or out?
GUIL. Both.
ROS. I see. (Pause.) Not much new there.
GUIL. Go into details. Delve. Probe the background, establish
the situation.
ROS. So-so your uncle is the king of Denmark?!
GUIL. And my father before him.
ROS. His father before him?
GUIL. No, my father before him.
ROS. But surely
GUIL. You might well ask.
ROS. Let me get it straight. Your father was king. You were his only son. Your father dies. You are of age. Your uncle becomes king.
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. Unorthodox.
GUIL. Undid me.
ROS. Undeniable. Where were you?
GUIL. In Germany.
ROS. Usurpation, then.
GUIL. He slipped in.
ROS. Which reminds me.
GUIL. Well, it would,
ROS. I don't want to be personal.
GUIL. It's common knowledge.
ROS. Your mother's marriage.
GUIL. He slipped in.
(Beat.)
ROS. (lugubriously): His body was still warm.
GUIL. So was hers.
ROS. Extraordinary.
GUIL. Indecent.
ROS. Hasty.
GUIL. Suspicious.
ROS. It makes you think.
GUIL. Don't think I haven't thought of it.
ROS. And with her husband's brother.
GUIL. They were close.
ROS. She went to him
GUIL. -Too close ROS. —for comfort.
GUIL. It looks bad.
ROS. It adds up.
GUIL. Incest to adultery.
ROS. Would you go so far?
GUIL. Never.
ROS. To sum up: your father, whom you love, dies, you are his heir, you come back to find that hardly was the corpse cold before his young brother popped on to his throne and into his sheets, thereby offending both legal and natural practice:
Now why exactly are you behaving in this extraordinary manner?
GUIL. I can't imagine! (Pause.) But all that is well known, common property. Yet he sent for us. And we did come.
ROS. (alert, ear cocked): I say! I heard music GUIL. We're here.
ROS. —Like a band—I thought I heard a band.
GUIL. Rosencrantz...
ROS. (absently, still listening): What?
(Pause, short.)
GUIL. (gently wry): Guildenstern...
Ros irritated by the repetition): What?
GUIL. Don't you discriminate at all?
ROS. (turning dumbly): Wha'?
(Pause.)
GUIL. Go and see if he's there.
ROS. Who?
GUIL. There.
(Ros goes to an upstage wing, looks, returns, formally making his report.)
ROS. Yes.
GUIL. What is he doing?
(RoS repeats movement.)
ROS. Talking.
GUIL. To himself?
(ROs starts to move. GUIL cuts in impatiently.)
Is he alone?
ROS. No.
GUIL. Then he's not talking to himself, is he?
ROS. Not by himself... Coming this way, I think. (Shiftily.)
Should we go?
GUIL. Why? We're marked now.
(HAMLET enters, backwards, talking, followed by POLONIUS, upstage. ROs and GUIL occupy the two downstage corners looking upstage.)
HAMLET.... for you yourself, sir, should be as old as I am if
like a crab you could go backward.
POLONIUS (aside): Though this be madness, yet there is method in it. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
HAMLET. Into my grave.
POLONIUS: Indeed, that's out of the air.
(HAMLET crosses to upstage exit, POLONIUS siding unintelligibly until—
My lord, I will take my leave of you.
HAMLET. You cannot take from me anything that I will more willingly part withal-except my life, except my live, except my life... •
POLONIUS (crossing downstage): Fare you well, my lord. (To ROS.) You go to seek Lord Hamlet? There he is.
ROS. (to POLONIUS): God save you sir.
(POLONIUS goes.)
GUIL. (calls upstage to HAMLET): My honoured lord!
ROS. My most dear lord!
(HAMLET centred upstage, turns to them.)
HAMLET. My excellent good friends! How dost thou
Guildenstern? (Coming downstage with an arm raised to ROS, GUIL meanwhile bowing to no greeting. HAMLET corrects himself. Still to ROS.) Ah Rosencrantz!
(They laugh good naturedly at the mistake. They all meet midstage, turn upstage to walk, HAMLET in the middle, arm over each shoulder.)
HAMLET. Good lads how do you both?
(A fade-out. That is to say, the conversation-see Shakespeare, Act II, Scene ii
-runs down quickly; it is still animated and
interspersed with laughter, but it is overtaken by rising music and fading light.)
ACT TWO
HAMLET, ROs and GUIL talking, the continuation of the previous scene. Their conversation, on the move, is indecipherable at first.
The first intelligible line is HAMLET's, coming at the end of a short speech- See Shakespeare Act II, scene ii.
HAMLET. S'blood, there is something in this more than natural, if
philosophy could find it out.
(A flourish from the TRAGEDIANS' band.)
420Я
GUIL. There are the players.
HAMLET. Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come then. (He takes their hands.) The appurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you in this garb, lest my extent to the players (which I tell you must show fairly outwards) should more appear like entertainment than yours. You are welcome. (About to leave.) But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
GUIL. In what, my dear lord?
HAMLET. I am but mad north north-west; when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
(POLONIUS enters as GUIL turns away.)
POLONIUS: Well be with you gentlemen.
HAMLET (to ROS): Mark you, Guildenstern (uncertainly to GUIL) and you too; at each ear a hearer. That great baby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts... (He takes Ros upstage with him, talking together.)
POLONIUS: My Lord! I have news to tell you.
HAMLET (releasing ROS and mimicking): My lord, I have news to tell you... When Roscius was an actor in Rome...
(ROS comes downstage to re-join GUIL.)
POLONIUS (as he follows HAMLET out): The actors are come
hither my lord.
HAMLET. Buzz, buzz.
(Exeunt HAMLET and POLONIUS.)
(Ros and GUIL ponder. Each reluctant to speak first.)
GUIL. Hm?
ROS. Yes?
GUIL. What?
ROS. I thought you...
GUIL. No.
ROS. Ah.
(Pause.)
GUIL. I think we can say we made some headway.
ROS. You think so?
GUIL. I think we can say that.
ROS. I think we can say he made us look ridiculous.
GUIL. We played it close to the chest of course.
ROS. (derisively): "Question and answer. Old ways are the best ways"! He was scoring off us all down the line.
GUIL. He caught us on the wrong foot once or twice, perhaps,
but I thought we gained some ground.
ROS. (simply): He murdered us.
GUIL. He might have had the edge.
ROS. (roused): Twenty-seven-three, and you think he might have
had the edge?! He murdered us.
GUIL. What about our evasions?
ROS. Oh, our evasions were lovely. "Were you sent for?" he says. "My lord, we were sent for..." I didn't know where to put myself.
GUIL. He had six rhetoricals
ROS. It was question and answer, all right. Twenty-seven
questions he got out in ten minutes, and answered three. I was waiting for you to delve. "When is he going to start delving?" I asked myself.
GUIL. —And two repetitions.
ROS. Hardly a leading question between us.
GUIL. We got his symptoms, didn't we?
ROS. Half of what he said meant something else, and the other
half didn't mean anything at all.
GUIL. Thwarted ambition— a sense of grievance, that's my
diagnosis.
ROS. Six rhetorical and two repetition, leaving nineteen of which we answered fifteen. And what did we get in return? He's depressed! ... Denmark's a prison and he'd rather live in a nutshell; some shadow-play about the nature of ambition, which never got down to cases, and finally one direct question which might have led somewhere, and led in fact to his illuminating claim to tell a hawk from a handsaw.
(Pause.)
GUIL. When the wind is southerly.
ROS. And the weather's clear.
GUIL. And when it isn't he can't.
ROS. He's at the mercy of the elements. (Licks his finger and holds it up-facing audience.) Is that southerly?
(They stare at audience.)
GUIL. It doesn't look southerly. What made you think so?
ROS. I didn't say I think so. It could be northerly for all I know.
GUIL. I wouldn't have thought so.
ROS. Well, if you're going to be dogmatic.
GUIL. Wait a minute-we came from roughly south according to
a rough map.
ROS. I see. Well, which way did we come in? (GUIL looks round
vaguely.) Roughly.
GUIL. (clears his throat): In the morning the sun would be easterly. I think we can assume that.
ROS. That it's morning?
GUIL. If it is, and the sun is over there (his right as he faces the audience) for instance, that (front) would be northerly. On the other hand, if it is not morning and the sun is over there (his left) ... that ... (lamely) would still be northerly. (picking up). To put it another way, if we came from down there (front) and it is morning, the sun would be up there (his left, and if it is actually over there (his right) and it's still morning, we must have come from up there (behind him), and if that is southerly (his left) and the sun is really over there (front), then it's the afternoon. However, if none of these is the case
ROS. Why don't you go and have a look?
GUIL. Pragmatism?!—is that all you have to offer? You seem to have no conception of where we stand! You won't find the answer written down for you in the bowl of a compass
-I can tell you that. (Pause.) Besides, you can never tell this far north-it's probably dark out there.
ROS. I merely suggest that the position of the sun, if it is out, would give you a rough idea of the time; alternatively, the clock, if it is going, would give you a rough idea of the position of the sun. I forget which you're trying to establish.
GUIL. I'm trying to establish the direction of the wind.
ROS. There isn't any wind. Draught, yes.
GUIL. In that case, the origin. Trace it to its source and it might give us a rough idea of the way we came in which might give us a rough idea of south, for further reference.
ROS. It's coming up through the floor. (He studies the floor.)
That can't be south, can it?
GUIL. That's not a direction. Lick your toe and wave it around
a bit.
(Ros considers the distance of his foot.)
ROS. No, I think you'd have to lick it for me.
(Pause.)
GUIL. I'm prepared to let the whole matter drop.
ROS. Or I could lick yours, of course.
GUIL. No thank you.
ROS. I'll even wave it around for you.
GUIL. (down ROS's throat): What in God's name is the matter
with you?
ROS. Just being friendly.
GUIL. (retiring): Somebody might come in. It's what we're
counting on, after all. Ultimately.
(Good pause.)
ROS. Perhaps they've all trampled each other to death in the rush... Give them a shout. Something provocative.
Intrigue them.
GUIL. Wheels have been set in motion, and they have their own pace, to which we are ... condemned. Each move is dictated by the previous one that is the meaning of order.
If we start being arbitrary it'll just be a shambles: at least, let us hope so. Because if we happened, just happened to discover, or even suspect, that our spontaneity was part of their order, we'd know that we were lost. (He sits.) A Chinaman of the T'ang Dynasty-and, by which definition, a philosopher— dreamed he was a butterfly, and from that moment he was never quite sure that he was not a butterfly dreaming it was a Chinese philosopher. Envy him; in his two-fold security.
ROS. Fire!
(A good pause. ROs leaps up and bellows at the audience.)
(GUIL jumps up.)
GUIL. Where?
ROS. It's all right—I'm demonstrating the misuse of free speech.
To prove that it exists. (He regards the audience, that is the direction, with contempt-and other directions, then front again.) Not a move. They should burn to death in their shoes.
(Ros takes out one of his coins. Spins it. Catches it. Looks at it. Replaces it.)
GUIL. What was it?
ROS. What?
GUIL. Heads or tails?
ROS. Oh. I didn't look.
GUIL. Yes you did.
ROS. Oh, did I? (He takes out a coin, studies it.) Quite right—
it rings a bell.
GUIL. What's the last thing you remember?
ROS. I don't wish to be reminded of it.
GUIL. We cross our bridges when we come to them and burn them behind us, with nothing to show for our progress except a memory of the smell of smoke, and a presumption that once our eyes watered.
(Ros approaches him brightly, holding a coin between finger and thumb. He covers it with his other hand, draws his fists apart and holds them for GUIL. GUIL considers them. Indicates the left hand, Ros opens it to show it empty.)
ROS. No.
(Repeat process. GUIL indicates left hand again. Ros shows it empty.)
Double bluff!
(Repeat process GUiL taps one hand, then the other hand, quickly. Ros inadvertently shows that both are empty. Ros laughs as GUIL turns upstage. ROs stops laughing, looks around his feet, pats his clothes, puzzled.)
(PoLONIUS breaks that up by entering upstage followed by the
TRAGEDIANS and HAMLET.)
POLONIUS (entering): Come sirs.
HAMLET. Follow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.
(Aside to the PLAYER, who is the last of the TRAGEDIANS.)
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play "The Murder of Gonzago"?
PLAYER. Ay, my lord.
HAMLET. We'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines which I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
PLAYER. Ay, my lord.
HAMLET. Very well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him
not.
(The PLAYER crossing downstage, notes ROs and GUIL. Stops.
HAMLET crossing downstage addresses them without pause.)
HAMLET. My good friends, I'll leave you till tonight. You are
welcome to Elsinore.
ROS. Good, my lord.
(HAMLET goes.)
GUIL. So you've caught up.
PLAYER. (coldly): Not yet, sir.
GUIL. Now mind your tongue, or we'll have it out and throw the rest of you away, like a nightingale at a Roman feast.
ROS. Took the very words out of my mouth.
GUIL. You'd be lost for words.
ROS. You'd be tongue-tied.
GUIL. Like a mute in a monologue.
ROS. Like a nightingale at a Roman feast.
GUIL. Your diction will go to pieces.
ROS. Your lines will be cut.
GUIL. To dumbshows.
ROS. And dramatic pauses.
GUIL. You'll never find your tongue.
ROS. Lick your lips.
GUIL. Taste your tears.
ROS. Your breakfast.
GUIL. You won't know the difference.
ROS. There won't be any.
GUIL. We'll take the very words out of your mouth.
ROS. So you've caught on.
GUIL. So you've caught up.
PLAYER. (tops): Not yet! (Bitterly.) You left us.
GUIL. Ah! I'd forgotten—you performed a dramatic spectacle by the wayside a thing much thought of in the New Testament. How did yours compare as an impromptu?
PLAYER. Badly-neither witnessed nor reported.
GUIL. Yes, I'm sorry we had to miss it. I hope you didn't leave anything out—I'd be furious to think I didn't miss all of it.
(The PLAYER, progressively aggrieved, now bursts out.)
PLAYER. We can't look each other in the face! (Pause, more in control.) You don't understand the humiliation of it-to be tricked out of the single assumption which makes our existence viable-that somebody is watching... The plot was two corpses gone before we caught sight of ourselves, stripped naked in the middle of nowhere and pouring ourselves down a bottomless well.
ROS. Is that thirty-eight?
PLAYER. (lost): There we were demented children mincing about in clothes that no one ever wore, speaking as no man ever spoke, swearing love in wigs and rhymed couplets, killing each other with wooden swords, hollow protestations of faith hurled after empty promises of vengeance-and every gesture, every pose, vanishing into the thin unpopulated air.
We ransomed our dignity to the clouds, and the uncomprehending birds listened. (He rounds on them.) Don't you see?! We're actors-we're the opposite of people! (They recoil nonplussed, his voice calms.) Think, in your head, now, think of the most... private ... secret... intimate thing you have ever done secure in the knowledge of its privacy... (He gives them— and the audience a good pause, Ros takes on a shifty look.) Are you thinking of it?
(He strikes with his voice and his head.) Well, I saw you do it!
(Ros leaps up, dissembling madly.)
ROS. You never! It's a lie! (He catches himself with a giggle in a vacuum and sits down again.)
PLAYER. We're actors... We pledged our identities, secure in the conventions of our trade; that someone would be watching. And then, gradually, no one was. We were caught, high and dry. It was not until the murderer's long soliloquy that we were able to look around; frozen as we were in profile, our eyes searched you out, first confidently, then hesitantly, then desperately as each patch of turf, each log, every exposed corner in every direction proved uninhabited, and all the while the murderous King addressed the horizon with his dreary interminable guilt...
Our heads began to move, wary as lizards, the corpse of unsullied Rosalinda peeped through his fingers, and the King faltered. Even then, habit and a stubborn trust that our audience spied upon us from behind the nearest bush, forced our bodies to blunder on long after they had emptied of meaning, until like runaway carts they dragged to a halt.
No one came forward. No one shouted at us. The silence was unbreakable, it imposed itself upon us; it was obscene.
We took off our crowns and swords and cloth of gold and moved silent on the road to Elsinore.
(Silence. Then GUIL claps solo with slow measured irony.)
GUIL. Brilliantly re-created— if these eyes could weep! ..
Rather strong on metaphor, mind you. No criticism only a matter of taste. And so here you are-with a vengeance.
That's a figure of speech .. isn't it? Well let's say we've made up for it, for you may have no doubt whom to thank for your performance at the court.
ROS. We are counting on you to take him out of himself. You are the pleasures which we draw him on to (he escapes a fractional giggle but recovers immediately) and by that I don't mean your usual filth; you can't treat royalty like people with normal perverted desires. They know nothing of that and you know nothing of them, to your mutual survival. So give him a good clean show suitable for all the family, or you GUIL. Or the night, after.
can rest assured you'll be playing the tavern tonight.
ROS. Or not.
PLAYER. We already have an entry here. And always have had.
GUIL. You've played for him before?
PLAYER. Yes, sir.
ROS. And what's his bent?
PLAYER. Classical.
ROS. Saucy!
GUIL. What will you play?
PLAYER. "The Murder of Gonzago".
GUIL. Full of fine cadence and corpses.
PLAYER. Pirated from the Italian...
ROS. What is it about?
PLAYER. It's about a King and Queen...
GUIL. Escapism! What else?
PLAYER. Blood
GUIL. —Love and rhetoric.
PLAYER. Yes. (Going.)
GUIL. Where are you going?
PLAYER. I can come and go as I please.
GUIL. You're evidently a man who knows his way around.
PLAYER. I've been here before.
GUIL. We're still finding our feet.
PLAYER. I should concentrate on not losing your heads.
GUIL. Do you speak from knowledge?
PLAYER. Precedent.
GUIL. You've been here before.
PLAYER. And I know which way the wind is blowing.
GUIL. Operating on two levels, are we?! How clever! I expect it comes naturally to you, being in the business so to speak.
(The PLAYER's grave face does not change. He makes to move off again. GUIL for the second time cuts him off.)
The truth is, we value your company, for want of any other. /We have been left so much to our own devices-after a while one welcomes the uncertainty of being left to other people's.
PLAYER. Uncertainty is the normal state. You're nobody special.
(He makes to leave again. GUIL loses his cool.)
GUIL. But for God's sake what are we supposed to do?!
PLAYER. Relax. Respond. That's what people do. You can't go through life questioning your situation at every turn.
GUL: But we don't know what's going on, or what to do with
ourselves. We don't know how to act.
PLAYER. Act natural. You know why you're here at least.
GUIL. We only know what we're told, and that's little enough.
And for all we know it isn't even true.
PLAYER. For all anyone knows, nothing is. Everything has to be taken on trust; truth is only that which is taken to be true. It's the currency of living. There may be nothing behind it, but it doesn't make any difference so long as it is honoured. One acts on assumptions, What do you assume?
ROS. Hamlet is not himself, outside or in. We have to glean what
afflicts him.
GUIL. He doesn't give much away.
PLAYER. Who does, nowadays?
GUIL. He's—melancholy.
PLAYER. Melancholy?
ROS. Mad.
PLAYER. How is he mad?
ROS. Ah. (To GUIL.) How is he mad?
GUIL. More morose than mad, perhaps.
PLAYER. Melancholy.
GUIL. Moody.
ROS. He has moods.
PLAYER. Of moroseness?
GUIL. Madness. And yet.
ROS. Quite.
GUIL. For instance.
ROS. He talks to himself, which might be madness.
GUIL. If he didn't talk sense, which he does.
ROS. Which suggests the opposite.
PLAYER. Of what?
(Small pause.)
GUIL. I think I have it. A man talking sense to himself is no ROS. Or just as mad.
madder than a man talking nonsense not to himself.
GUIL. Or just as mad.
ROS. And he does both.
GUIL. So there you are.
ROS. Stark raving sane.
(Pause.)
PLAYER. Why?
GUIL. Ah. (To Ros.) Why?
ROS. Exactly.
GUIL. Exactly what?
ROS. Exactly why.
GUIL. Exactly why what?
ROS. What?
GUIL. Why?
ROS. Why what, exactly?
GUIL. Why is he mad?!
ROS. I don't know!
(Beat.)
PLAYER. The old man thinks he's in love with his daughter.
ROS. (appalled): Good God! We're out of our depth here.
PLAYER. No, no, no—he hasn't got a daughter-the old man
thinks he's in love with his daughter.
ROS. The old man is?
PLAYER. Hamlet, in love with the old man's daughter, the old
man thinks.
ROS. Ha! It's beginning to make sense! Unrequited passion!
GUIL. (to PLAYER): How do you know?
PLAYER. I keep my ear to the ground.
GUIL. One day someone will step on your head.
(The PLAYER moves.)
(Fascist.) Nobody leaves this room! (Pause, lamely.)
Without a very good reason.
PLAYER. Why not?
GUIL. All this strolling about is getting too arbitrary by half-I'm rapidly losing my grip. From now on reason will prevail.
PLAYER. (thoughtfully): I had a reason...
GUIL. Well?
PLAYER. (he remembers): I have lines to learn.
GUIL. Pass!
PLAYER. Good day!
GUIL. Good morning!
ROS. Good afternoon!
GUIL. Good night!
PLAYER. Goodbye!
(The PLAYER passes into one of the wings. Ros cups his hands and shouts into the opposite one.)
ROS. Next!
(But no one comes.)
GUIL. What did you expect?
ROS. Something... someone... nothing. (They sit facing front.)
Are you hungry?
GUIL. No, are you?
ROS. (thinks): No. You remember that coin?
GUIL. No.
ROS. I think I lost it.
GUIL. What coin?
ROS. I don't remember exactly.
(Pause.)
GUIL. Oh, that coin ... clever.
ROS. I can't remember how I did it.
GUIL. It probably comes natural to you.
ROS. Yes, I've got a show-stopper there.
GUIL. Do it again.
(Slight pause.)
ROS. We can't afford it.
GUIL. Yes, one must think of the future.
ROS. It's the normal thing.
GUIL. To have one. One is, after all, having it all the time... now… and now… and now…
ROS. It could go on for ever. Well, not for ever, I suppose. (Pause.)
Do you ever think of yourself as actually dead, lying in a box with a lid on it?
GUIL. No.
ROS. Nor do I, really... It's silly to be depressed by it. I mean one thinks of it like being alive in a box, one keeps forgetting to take into account the fact that one is dead... which should make all the difference... shouldn't it? I mean, you'd never know you were in a box, would you? It would be just like being asleep in a box. Not that I'd like to sleep in a box, mind you, not without any air-you'd wake up dead, for a start and then where would you be? Apart from inside a box. That's the bit I don't like, frankly. That's why I don't think of it...
(GuiL stirs restlessly, pulling his cloak round him.)
Because you'd be helpless, wouldn't you? Stuffed in a box like that, I mean you'd be in there for ever. Even taking into account the fact that you're dead, it isn't a pleasant thought.
Especially if you're dead, really ... ask yourself, if I asked you straight off-I'm going to stuff you in this box now, would you rather be alive or dead? Naturally, you'd prefer to be alive. Life in a box is better than no life at all. I expect.
You'd have a chance at least. You could lie there thinking— well, at least I'm not dead! In a minute someone's going to bang on the lid and tell me to come out. (Banging the floor with his fists.) "Hey you, whatsyername! Come out of there!"
GUIL. (jumps up savagely): You don't have to flog it to death!
(Pause.)
ROS. I wouldn't think about it, if I were you. You'd only get depressed. (Pause.) Eternity is a terrible thought. I mean, where's it going to end? (Pause, then brightly.) Two early Christians chanced to meet in Heaven. "Saul of Tarsus yet!" cried one. "What are you doing here?!" ...
"Tarsus-Schmarsus", replied the other, "I'm Paul already."
(Ros stands up restlessly and flaps his arms.)
They don't care. We count for nothing. We could remain silent till we're green in the face, they wouldn't come.
GUIL. Blue, red.
ROS. A Christian, a Moslem and a Jew chanced to meet in a closed carriage... "Silverstein!" cried the Jew, "Who's your friend?" ... "His name's Abdullah", replied the Moslem, "but he's no friend of mine since he became a convert." (He leaps up again, stamps his foot and shouts into the wings.) All right, we know you're in there! Come out talking! (Pause.) We have no control. None at all... (He paces.) Whatever became of the moment when one first knew about death? There must have been one, a moment, in childhood when it first occurred to you that you don't go on for ever. It must have been shattering stamped into one's memory. And yet I can't remember it. It never occurred to me at all. What does one make of that? We must be born with an intuition of mortality. Before we know the words for it, before we know that there are words, out we come, bloodied and squalling with the knowledge that for all the compasses in the world, there's only one direction, and time is its only measure. He rejects, getting more desperate and rapid.) A Hindu, a Buddhist and a lion-tamer chanced to meet, in a circus on the Indo-Chinese border. (He breaks out.) They're taking us for granted!
Well, I won't stand for it! In future, notice will be taken.
(He wheels again to face into the wings.) Keep out, then! I forbid anyone to enter! (No one comes-Breathing heavily.)
That's better...
(Immediately, behind him a grand procession enters, principally CLAUDIUS, GERTRUDE, POLONIUS and OPHELIA.
CLAUDIUS takes Ros's elbow as he passes and is immediately deep in conversation: the context is Shakespeare Act III, Scene i. GUIL still faces front as CLAUDIUS, ROS, etc., pass upstage and turn.)
GUIL. Death followed by eternity. the worst of both worlds.
It is a terrible thought.
(He turns upstage in time to take over the conversation with
CLAUDIUS. GERTRUDE and ROS head downstage.)
GERTRUDE: Did he receive you well?
ROS. Most like a gentleman.
GUIL. (returning in time to take it up): But with much forcing of
his disposition.
ROS. (a flat lie and he knows it and shows it, perhaps catching GUIL's eye): Niggard of question, but of our demands most free in his reply.
GERTRUDE: Did you assay him to any pastime?
ROS. Madam, it so fell out that certain players We o'erraught on the way: of these we told him And there did seem in him a kind of joy To hear of it. They are here about the court, And, as I think, they have already order This night to play before him.
POLONIUS: Tis most true
And he beseeched me to entreat your Majesties To hear and see the matter.
CLAUDIUS: With all my heart, and it doth content me
To hear him so inclined.
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge And drive his purpose into these delights.
ROS. We shall, my lord.
CLAUDIUS (leading out procession):
Sweet Gertrude, leave us, too,
For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as t'were by accident, may here Affront Ophelia...
(Exeunt CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE.)
ROS. (peevish): Never a moment's peace! In and out, on and oft,
they're coming at us from all sides.
GUIL. You're never satisfied.
ROS. Catching us on the trot... Why can't we go by them?
GUIL. What's the difference?
ROS. I'm going.
(Ros pulls his cloak round him. GUIL ignores him. Without confidence ROs heads upstage. He looks out and comes back
quickly.）
He's coming.
GUIL. What's he doing?
ROS. Nothing.
GUIL. He must be doing something.
ROS. Walking.
GUIL. On his hands?
ROS. No, on his feet.
GUIL. Stark naked?
ROS. Fully dressed.
GUIL. Selling toffee apples?
ROS. Not that I noticed.
GUIL. You could be wrong?
ROS. I don't think so.
(Pause.)
GUIL. I can't for the life of me see how we're going to get into
conversation.
(HAMLET enters upstage, and pauses, weighing up the pros and cons of making his quietus.)
(ROS and GUIL watch him.)
ROS. Nevertheless, I suppose one might say that this was a chance... One might well... accost him... Yes, it definitely looks like a chance to me... Something on the lines of a direct informal approach... man to man... straight from the shoulder... Now look here, what's it all about . .. sort of thing. Yes. Yes, this looks like one to be grabbed with both hands, I should say ... if I were asked.
... No point in looking at a gift horse till you see the whites of its eyes, etcetera. (He has moved towards HAMLET but his nerve fails. He returns.) We're overawed, that's our trouble. When it comes to the point we succumb to their personality...
(OPHELIA enters, with prayerbook, a religious procession of one.)
HAMLET. Nymph, in thy orisons be all my sins remembered.
(At his voice she has stopped for him, he catches her up.)
OPHELIA: Good my lord, how does your honour for this many a
day?
HAMLET. I humbly thank you—well, well, well.
(They disappear talking into the wing.)
ROS. It's like living in a public park!
GUIL. Very impressive. Yes, I thought your direct informal approach was going to stop this thing dead in its tracks there. If I might make a suggestion-shut up and sit down.
Stop being perverse.
ROS. (near tears): I'm not going to stand for it!
(A FEMALE FIGURE, ostensibly the QUEEN, enters. ROS marches up behind her, puts his hands over her eyes and says with a desperate frivolity.)
ROS. Guess who?!
PLAYER. (having appeared in a downstage corner): Alfred!
(Ros lets go, spins around. He has been holding ALFRED, in his robe and blonde wig. PLAYER is in the downstage corner still. Ros comes down to that exit. The PLAYER does not budge.
He and Ros stand toe to toe.)
ROS. Excuse me.
(The PLAYER lifts his downstage foot. Ros bends to put his hand on the floor. The PLAYER lowers his foot. Ros screams and leaps away.)
PLAYER. (gravely): I beg your pardon.
GUIL. (to ROS): What did he do?
PLAYER. I put my foot down.
ROS. My hand was on the floor!
GUIL. You put your hand under his foot?
ROS. I…
GUIL. What for?
ROS. I thought-
- (Grabs GUIL.) Don't leave me!
(He makes a break for an exit. A TRAGEDIAN dressed as a KING enters. Ros recoils, breaks for the opposite wing. Two cloaked TRAGEDIANS enter. ROS tries again but another TRAGEDIAN enters, and ROS retires to midstage. The PLAYER claps his hands matter-of-factly.)
PLAYER. Right! We haven't got much time.
GUIL. What are you doing?
PLAYER. Dress rehearsal. Now if you two wouldn't mind just moving back... there ... good... (To TRAGEDIANS.) Everyone ready? And for goodness sake, remember what we're doing. (To ROs and GUIL.) We always use the same costumes more or less, and they forget what they are supposed to be in you see... Stop picking your nose, Alfred. When Queens have to they do it by a cerebral process passed down in the blood... Good. Silence! Off we go!
PLAYER-KING. Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart-
(PLAYER jumps up angrily.)
PLAYER. No, no, no! Dumbshow first, your confounded majesty!
(To Ros and GUIL.) They're a bit out of practice, but they always pick up wonderfully for the deaths it brings out the poetry in them.
GUIL. How nice.
PLAYER. There's nothing more unconvincing than an
unconvincing death.
GUIL. I'm sure.
(PLAYER claps his hands.)
PLAYER. Act One-moves now.
(The mime. Soft music from a recorder. PLAYER-KING and PLAYER-QUEEN embrace. She kneels and makes a show of protestation to him. He takes her up and declining his head upon her neck. He lies down. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him.)
GUIL. What is the dumbshow for?
PLAYER. Well, it's a device, really-it makes the action that follows more or less comprehensible; you understand, we are tied down to a language which makes up in obscurity what it lacks in style.
(The mime (continued)-enter another. He takes off the SLEEPER's crown, kisses it. He has brought in a small bottle of liquid. He pours the poison in the SLEEPER's ear, and leaves him. The SLEEPER convulses heroically, dying.)
ROS. Who was that?
PLAYER. The King's brother and uncle to the Prince.
GUIL. Not exactly fraternal.
PLAYER. Not exactly avuncular, as time goes on.
(The QUEEN returns, makes passionate action, finding the KING dead. The POISONER comes in again, attended by two others (the two in cloaks). The POISONER seems to console with her. The dead body is carried away. The POISONER woos the QUEEN with gifts. She seems harsh awhile but in the end accepts his love. End of mime, at which point, the wail of a woman in torment and OPHELIA appears, wailing, closely followed by HAMLET in a hysterical state, shouting at her, circling her, both midstage.)
HAMLET. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath made me mad!
(She falls on her knees weeping.)
I say we will have no more marriage! (His voice drops to include the TRAGEDIANS, who have frozen.) Those that are married already (he leans close to the PLAYER-QUEEN and POISONER, speaking with quiet edge) all but one shall live.
(He smiles briefly at them without mirth, and starts to back out, his parting shot rising again.) The rest shall keep as they are. (As he leaves, OPHELIA tottering upstage, he speaks into her ear a quick clipped sentence.) To a nunnery, go.
(He goes out. OPHELIA falls on to her knees upstage, her sobs barely audible. A slight silence.)
PLAYER-KING: Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart
(CLAUDIUS enters with POLONIUS and goes over to OPHELIA and lifts her to her feet. The TRAGEDIANS jump back with heads inclined.)
CLAUDIUS: Love? His affections do not that way tend, Or what he spake, though it lacked form a little, Was not like madness. There's something in his soul o'er which his melancholy sits on brood, and I do doubt the hatch and the disclose will be some danger; which for to prevent I have in quick determination thus set it down: he shall with speed to England... • (Which carries the three of them-CLAUDIUS, POLONIUS, OPHELIA-out of sight. The PLAYER moves, clapping his hands for attention.)
PLAYER. Gentlemen! (They look at him.) It doesn't seem to be coming. We are not getting it at all. (To GUIL.) What did you think?
GUIL. What was I supposed to think?
PLAYER. (to TRAGEDIANS): You're not getting across!
(Ros had gone half way up to OPHELIA; he returns.)
ROS. That didn't look like love to me.
GUIL. Starting from scratch again...
PLAYER. (to TRAGEDIANS): It was a mess.
ROS. (to GUIL): It's going to be chaos on the night.
GUIL. Keep back-we're spectators.
PLAYER. Act Two! Positions!
GUIL. Wasn't that the end?
PLAYER. Do you call that an ending?—with practically everyone on his feet? My goodness no over your dead body,
GUIL. How am I supposed to take that?
PLAYER. Lying down. (He laughs briefly and in a second has never laughed in his life.) There's a design at work in all art surely you know that? Events must play themselves out to aesthetic, moral and logical conclusion,
GUIL. And what's that, in this case?
PLAYER. It never varies—we aim at the point where everyone
who is marked for death dies.
GUIL. Marked?
PLAYER. Between "just desserts" and "tragic irony" we are given quite a lot of scope for our particular talent.
Generally speaking, things have gone about as far as they can possibly go when things have got about as bad as they reasonably get. (He switches on a smile.)
GUIL. Who decides?
PLAYER. (switching off his smile): Decides? It is written.
(He turns away. GUIL grabs him and spins him back violently.) (Unflustered.) Now if you're going to be subtle, we'll miss each other in the dark. I'm referring to oral tradition. So to speak.
(GUIL releases him.)
We're tragedians, you see. We follow directions-there is no choice involved. The bad end unhappily, the good unluckily.
That is what tragedy means. (Calling.)
Positions!
(The TRAGEDIANS have taken up positions for the continuation of the mime: which in this case means a love scene, sexual and passionate, between the QUEEN and the POISONER/KING.)
PLAYER. Go!
(The lovers begin. The PLAYER contributes a breathless commentary for ROS and GUIL.)
Having murdered his brother and wooed the widow-the poisoner mounts the throne! Here we see him and his queen give rein to their unbridled passion! She little knowing that the man she holds in her arms ROS. Oh, I say-here-really! You can't do that!
PLAYER. Why not?
ROS. Well, really—I mean, people want to be entertained they don't come expecting sordid and gratuitous filth.
PLAYER. You're wrong they do! Murder, seduction and incest
—what do you want-jokes?
ROS. I want a good story, with a beginning, middle and end.
PLAYER. (to GUIL): And you?
GUIL. I'd prefer art to mirror life, if it's all the same to you.
PLAYER. It's all the same to me, sir. (To the grappling LOVERS.)
All right, no need to indulge yourselves. (They get up-To GUIL.) I come on in a minute. Lucianus, nephew to the king! (Turns his attention to the TRAGEDIANS.) Next!
(They disport themselves to accommodate the next piece of mime, which consists of the PLAYER himself exhibiting an excitable anguish (choreographed, stylized) leading to an impassioned scene with the QUEEN (cf. "The Closet Scene", Shakespeare Act III, Scene iv) and a very stylized reconstruction of a POLONIUS figure being stabbed behind the arras (the murdered KING to stand in for POLONIUS) while the PLAYER himself continues his breathless commentary for the benefit of Ros and GUIL.)
PLAYER. Lucianus, nephew to the king ... usurped by his uncle and shattered by his mother's incestuous marriage... loses his reason... throwing the court into turmoil and disarray as he alternates between bitter melancholy and unrestricted lunacy ... staggering from the suicidal (a pose) to the homicidal (here he kills "POLONIUS") ... he at last confronts his mother and in a scene of provocative ambiguity, (a somewhat oedipal embrace) begs her to repent and recant-(He springs up, still talking.)
The King-(he pushes forward the POISONER/KING) tormented by guilt-haunted by fear— decides to despatch his nephew to England—and entrusts this undertaking to two smiling accomplices-friends-courtiers-to two spies
He has swung round to bring together the POISONER/KING and the two cloaked TRAGEDIANS; the latter kneel and accept a scroll from the KING.)
-giving them a letter to present to the English court-And so they departon board ship-
(The two SPIEs position themselves on either side of the
PLAYER, and the three of them sway gently in unison, the motion of a boat; and then the PLAYER detaches himself.
—and they arrive-
(One spy shades his eyes at the horizon.
—and disembark—and present themselves before the English king—(An exchange of headgear creates the ENGLISH KING from the remaining player-that is, the PLAYER who played the original murdered king.
But where is the Prince? Where indeed? The plot has thickened—a twist of fate and cunning has put into their hands a letter that seals their deaths!
(The two SPIEs present their letter; the ENGLISH KING reads it and orders their deaths. They stand up as the PLAYER whips off their cloaks preparatory to execution.)
Traitors hoist by their own petard?—or victims of the gods?
—we shall never know!
(The whole mime has been fluid and continuous but now ROS moves forward and brings it to a pause. What brings ROS forward is the fact that under their cloaks the two SPIES are wearing coats identical to those worn by ROS and GUIL, whose coats are now covered by their cloaks. Ros approaches "his" SPY doubtfully. He does not quite understand why the coats are familiar. ROs stands close, touches the coat, thoughtfully...)
ROS. Well, if it isn't! No, wait a minute, don't tell me—it's a long time since-where was it? Ah, this is taking me back to-when was it? I know you, don't I? I never forget a face (he looks into the sPY's face)... not that I know yours, that is. For a moment I thought—no, I don't know you, do I? Yes, I'm afraid you're quite wrong. You must have mistaken me for someone else.
(GUIL meanwhile has approached the other SPY, brow creased in thought.)
PLAYER. (to GUIL): Are you familiar with this play?
GUIL. No.
PLAYER. A slaughterhouse eight corpses all told. It brings out
the best in us.
GUIL. (tense, progressively rattled during the whole mime and commentary): You!—What do you know about death?
PLAYER. It's what the actors do best. They have to exploit whatever talent is given to them, and their talent is dying.
They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly, or from a great height.
My own talent is more general. I extract significance from melodrama, a significance which it does not in fact contain; but occasionally, from out of this matter, there escapes a thin beam of light that, seen at the right angle, can crack the shell of mortality.
ROS. Is that all they can do-die?
PLAYER. No, no-they kill beautifully. In fact some of them kill even better than they die. The rest die better than they kill.
They're a team.
ROS. Which ones are which?
PLAYER. There's not much in it.
GUIL. (fear, derision): Actors! The mechanics of cheap
melodrama! That isn't death! (More quietly.) You scream and choke and sink to your knees, but it doesn't bring death home to anyone—it doesn't catch them unawares and start the whisper in their skulls that says-"One day you are going to die." (He straightens up.) You die so many times; how can you expect them to believe in your death?
PLAYER. On the contrary, it's the only kind they do believe.
They're conditioned to it. I had an actor once who was condemned to hang for stealing a sheep or a lamb, I forget which—so I got permission to have him hanged in the middle of a play-had to change the plot a bit but I thought it would be effective, you know—and you wouldn't believe it, he just wasn't convincing! It was impossible to suspend one's disbelief-and what with the audience jeering and throwing peanuts, the whole thing was a disaster!— he did nothing but cry all the time-right out of character-just stood there and cried... Never again.
(In good humour he has already turned back to the mime: the two SPIES awaiting execution at the hands of the PLAYER, who takes his dagger out of his belt.)
Audiences know what to expect, and that is all that they are prepared to believe in. (To the SPIES, as he stabs them with his dagger.) Show!
(The spIEs die at some length, rather well.)
(The light has begun to go, and it fades as they die, and as GUIL speaks.)
GUIL. No, no, no... you've got it all wrong ... you can't act death. The fact of it is nothing to do with seeing it happen—﻿it's not gasps and blood and falling about—that isn't what makes it death. It's just a man failing to reappear, that's all
—-﻿now you see him, now you don't, that's the only thing that's real: here one minute and gone the next and never coming back—an exit, unobtrusive and unannounced, a disappearance gathering weight as it goes on, until, finally, it is heavy with death.
(The two SPIEs lie still, barely visible. The PLAYER comes forward and throws the SPIES' cloaks over their bodies. ROS starts to clap, slowly.)
BLACKOUT.
(A second of silence, then much noise. Shouts ... "The King rises!' ... "Give d'er the play!" ... and cries for "Lights, lights, lights!")
When the light comes, after a few seconds, it comes as a sunrise.)
(The stage is empty save for two cloaked FIGURES sprawled on the ground in the approximate positions last held by the dead
SPIES. As the light grows, they are seen to be ROs and GUIL, and to be resting quite comfortably. Ros raises himself on his elbows and shades his eyes as he stares into the auditorium.
Finally:)
ROS. That must be east, then. I think we can assume that.
GUIL. I'm assuming nothing.
ROS. No, it's all right. That's the sun. East.
GUIL. (looks up): Where?
ROS. I watched it come up.
gus: No...it was viry slowly, time, you see, and you opened your eyes very, very slowly. If you'd been facing back there you'd be swearing that was east.
ROS. (standing up): You're a mass of prejudice.
GUIL. I've been taken in before.
ROS. (looks out over the audience): Rings a bell.
GUIL. They're waiting to see what we're going to do.
ROS. Good old east.
GUIL. As soon as we make a move they'll come pouring in from every side, shouting obscure instructions, confusing us with ridiculous remarks, messing us about from here to breakfast and getting our names wrong.
(Ros starts to protest but he has hardly opened his mouth before:)
CLAUDIUS (off-stage-with urgency): Ho, Guildenstern!
(GUIL is still prone. Small pause.)
ROS AND GUIL. You're wanted. .
(GUIL furiously leaps to his feet as CLAUDIUS and GERTRUDE enter. They are in some desperation.)
CLAUDIUS: Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain, and from his mother's closet hath he dragged him. Go seek him out; speak fair and bring the body into the chapel. I pray you haste in this. (As he and GERTRUDE are hurrying out.) Come Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends and let them know both what we mean to do...
(They've gone.)
(RoS and GUIL remain quite still.)
GUIL. Well...
ROS. Quite...•
GUIL. Well, well.
ROS. Quite; quite. (Nods with spurious confidence.) Seek him out.
(Pause.) Etcetera.
GUIL. Quite.
ROS. Well. (Small pause.) Well, that's a step in the right
direction.
GUIL. You didn't like him?
ROS. Who?
GUIL. Good God, I hope more tears are shed for us!...
ROS. Well, it's progress, isn't it? Something positive. Seek him out. (Looks round without moving his feet.) Where does one begin... ? (Takes one step towards the wings and halts.)
GUIL. Well, that's a step in the right direction.
ROS. You think so? He could be anywhere.
GUIL. All right—you go that way, I'll go this way.
ROS. Right.
(They walk towards opposite wings. ROs halts.)
No.
(GUIL halts.)
You go this way-I'll go that way.
GUIL. All right.
(They march towards each other, cross. Ros halts.)
ROS. Wait a minute.
(GUIL halts.)
I think we should stick together. He might be violent.
GUIL. Good point. I'll come with you.
(GUIL marches across to ROS. They turn to leave. ROs halts.)
ROS. No, I'll come with you.
GUIL. Right.
(They turn, march across to the opposite wing. Ros halts.
GUIL halts.)
ROS. I'll come with you, my way.
GUIL. All right.
(They turn again and march across. ROS halts. GUIL halts.)
ROS. I've just thought. If we both go, he could come here. That
would be stupid, wouldn't it?
GUIL. All right-I'll stay, you go.
ROS. Right.
(GUIL marches to midstage.)
I say.
(GUIL wheels and carries on marching back towards ROs who starts marching downstage. They cross. Ros halts.)
I've just thought.
(GUIL halts.)
We ought to stick together; he might be violent.
GUIL. Good point.
(Guil marches down to join Ros. They stand still for a moment in their original positions.)
Well, at last we're getting somewhere.
(Pause.)
GUIL. Of course, he might not come.
ROS. (airily): Oh, he'll come.
GUIL. We'd have some explaining to do.
ROS. He'll come. (Airily wanders upstage.) Don't worry take
my word for it— (looks out-
GUIL. What's he doing?
—is appalled). He's coming!
ROS. Walking.
GUIL. Alone?
ROS. No.
GUIL. Who's with him?
ROS. The old man.
GUIL. Walking?
ROS. No.
GUIL. Not walking?
ROS. No.
GUIL. Ah. That's an opening if ever there was one. (And is suddenly galvanized into action.) Let him walk into the trap!
ROS. What trap?
GUIL. You stand there! Don't let him pass!
(He positions Ros with his back to one wing, facing
HAMLET's entrance.)
(GUIL positions himself next to Ros, a few feet away, so that they are covering one side of the stage, facing the opposite side. GUIL unfastens his belt. Ros does the same. They join the two belts, and hold them taut between them. ROS's trousers slide slowly down.)
(HAMLET enters opposite, slowly, dragging POLONIUS'S BODY.
He enters upstage, makes a small arc and leaves by the same side, a few feet downstage.)
(Ros and GUIL, holding the belts taut, stare at him in some bewilderment.)
(HAMLET leaves, dragging the BODY. They relax the strain on the belts.)
ROS. That was close.
GUIL. There's a limit to what two people can do.
(They undo the belts: Ros pulls up his trousers.)
ROS. (worriedly he walks a few paces towards HAMLET's exit): He
was dead.
GUIL. Of course he's dead!
ROS. (turns to GUIL): Properly.
GUIL. (angrily): Death's death, isn't it?
(Ros falls silent. Pause.)
Perhaps he'll come back this way.
(Ros starts to take off his belt.)
No, no, no!—if we can't learn by experience, what else have we got?
(ROS desists.)
(Pause.)
ROS. Give him a shout.
GUIL. I thought we'd been into all that.
ROS. (shouts): Hamlet!
GUIL. Don't be absurd.
ROS. (shouts): Lord Hamlet!
(HAMLET enters. ROS is a little dismayed.)
What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
HAMLET. Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
ROS. Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence and bear it
to the chapel.
HAMLET. Do not believe it.
ROS. Believe what?
HAMLET. That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
Besides, to be demanded of a sponge, what replication should be made by the son of a king?
ROS. Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
HAMLET. Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the King best service in the end. He keeps them, like an ape, in the corner of his jaw, first mouthed, to be last swallowed. When he needs what you have gleaned, it is but squeezing you and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
ROS. I understand you not, my lord.
HAMLET. I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a foolish ear.
ROS. My lord, you must tell us where the body is and go with us
to the King.
HAMLET. The body is with the King, but the King is not with the
body. The King is a thing
GUIL. A thing, my lord
- ?
HAMLET. Of nothing. Bring me to him.
(HAMLET moves resolutely towards one wing. They move with him, shepherding. Just before they reach the exit, HAMLET, apparently seeing CLAUDIUS approaching from off stage, bends low in a sweeping bow. ROS and GUIL, cued by Hamlet, also bow deeply— a sweeping ceremonial bow with their cloaks swept round them. HAMLET, however, continues the movement into an about-turn and walks off in the opposite direction. ROS and GUIL, with their heads low do not notice.
No one comes on. Ros and GUIL squint upwards and find that they are bowing to nothing.
CLAUDIUS enters behind them. At his first words they leap up and do a double-take.)
CLAUDIUS: How now? What hath befallen?
ROS. Where the body is bestowed, my lord, we cannot get from
him.
CLAUDIUS: But where is he?
ROS. (fractional hesitation): Without, my lord; guarded to know
your pleasure.
CLAUDIUS (moves): Bring him before us.
(This hits Ros between the eyes but only his eyes show it.
Again his hesitation is fractional. And then with great deliberation he turns to GUIL.)
ROS. Ho! Bring in the lord.
(Again there is a fractional moment in which ROs is smug, GUIL is trapped and betrayed. GUIL opens his mouth and closes it.)
(The situation is saved:)
Tofe
(HAMLET, escorted, is marched in just as CLAUDIUS leaves.
HAMLET and his ESCORT cross the stage and go out, following CLAUDIUS.)
ROS. (thoughtfully): Madness, then.
GUIL. A matter of sore distraction.
ROS. Antic disposition.
GUIL. Which may or may not have been put on.
ROS. Which is another thing—he could have been a sane man pretending to be mad or a mad man pretending to be sane.
GUIL. Or a mad man who-didn't know he was mad but was
pretending to be mad nevertheless.
ROS. That is to say, even madder than he didn't know he was.
(Small pause.)
GUIL. Why?
ROS. Quite. Well, to begin with.
GUIL. He lacked advancement.
ROS. For one thing.
GUIL. His father's death.
ROS. For another.
GUIL. His mother getting married so soon.
ROS. To her husband's brother.
GUIL. That's a bit close.
ROS. And a bit soon. Who knows?
GUIL. Who knows what?
ROS. And then the girl. Did he or didn't he?
GUIL. Did she?
ROS. Did she what?
GUIL. Unrequited love.
ROS. I thought she loved him back.
GUIL. He didn't love her back.
ROS. Though he loved her front.
GUIL. First one, then the other.
ROS. Probably.
GUIL. Add it all up, it's enough to drive one mad.
(Lighting changes to Exterior.)
ROS. (moves to go): All right, then?
GUIL. (does not move: thoughtfully): And yet it doesn't seem
enough; to have breathed such significance. Can that be all?
And why us?-anybody would have done. And we have contributed nothing.
ROS. It was a trying episode while it lasted, but they've done with
us now.
GUIL. Done what?
ROS. I don't pretend to have understood. Frankly, I'm not very interested. If they won't tell us, that's their affair. (He wanders upstage towards the exit.) For my part, I'm only glad that that's the last we've seen of him-(And he glances offstage and turns front, his face betraying the fact that HAMLET is there.)
GUIL. I knew it wasn't the end...
ROS. (high): What else?!
GUIL. We're taking him to England. What's he doing?
(Ros goes upstage and returns.)
ROS. Talking.
GUIL. To himself?
(Ros makes to go, GUIL cuts him off.)
Is he alone?
ROS. No, he's with a soldier.
GUIL. Then he's not talking to himself, is he?
ROS. Not by himself... Should we go?
GUIL. Where?
ROS. Anywhere.
GUIL. Why?
(Ros puts up his head listening.)
ROS. There it is again. (In anguish.) All I ask is a change of
ground!
GUIL. (coda): Give us this day our daily round...
(HAMLET enters behind them, talking with a soldier in arms.
RoS and GUIL don't look round.)
ROS. They'll have us hanging about till we're dead. At least.
And the weather will change. (Looks up.) The spring can't last for ever.
HAMLET. Good sir, whose powers are these?
SOLDIER. They are of Norway, sir.
HAMLET. How purposed, sir, I pray you?
SOLDIER. Against some part of Poland.
HAMLET. Who commands them, sir?
SOLDIER. The nephew to old Norway, Fortinbras.
ROS. We'll be cold. The summer won't last.
GUIL. It's autumnal.
ROS. (examining the ground): No leaves.
GUIL. Autumnal-nothing to do with leaves. It is to do with a certain brownness at the edges of the day... Brown is creeping up on us, take my word for it... Russets and tangerine shades of old gold flushing the very outside edge of the senses... deep shining ochres, burnt umber and parchments of baked earth-reflecting on itself and through itself, filtering the light. At such times, perhaps, coincidentally, the leaves might fall, somewhere, by repute.
Yesterday was blue, like smoke.
ROS. (head up, listening): I got it again then.
(They listen-faintest sound of TRAGEDIAN's band.)
HAMLET. I humbly thank you, sir.
SOLDIER. God by you, sir. (Exit.)
(Ros gets up quickly and goes to HAMLET.)
ROS. Will it please you go, my lord?
HAMLET. I'll be with you straight. Go you a little before.
(HAMLET turns to face upstage. ROS returns down. GUIL faces front, doesn't turn.)
GUIL. Is he there?
ROS. Yes.
GUIL. What's he doing?
(Ros looks over his shoulder.)
ROS. Talking.
GUIL. To himself?
ROS. Yes.
(Pause. ROS makes to leave.)
GUIL. Why can't you be still?
ROS. He said to go on.
GUIL. I'm staying.
ROS. He said we can go. Cross my heart.
GUIL. I like to know where. I am. Even if I don't know where I am, I like to know that. If we go there's no knowing.
ROS. No knowing what?
GUIL. If we'll ever come back.
ROS. We don't want to come back.
GUIL. That may very well be true, but do we want to go?
ROS. We'll be free.
iGUIL. I don't know. It's the same sky.
ROS. We've come this far.
(He moves towards exit. GUIL follows him.) And besides, anything could happen yet.
(They go.)
BLACKOUT
ACT THREE
Opens in pitch darkness.
Soft sea sounds.
After several seconds of nothing, a voice from the dark ...
GUIL. Are you there?
ROS. Where?
GUIL. (bitterly): A flying start...
(Pause.)
ROS. Is that you?
GUIL. Yes.
ROS. How do you know?
GUIL. (explosion): Oh-for-God's-sake!
ROS. We're not finished, then?
GUIL. Well, we're here, aren't we?
ROS. Are we? I can't see a thing.
GUIL. You can still think, can't you?
ROS. I think so.
GUIL. You can still talk.
ROS. What should I say?
GUIL. Don't bother. You can feel, can't you?
ROS. Ah! There's life in me yet!
GUIL. What are you feeling?
ROS. A leg. Yes, it feels like my leg.
GUIL. How does it feel?
ROS. Dead.
GUIL. Dead?
ROS. (panic): I can't feel a thing!
GUIL. Give it a pinch! (Immediately he yelps.)
ROS. Sorry.
GUIL. Well, that's cleared that up.
(Longer pause: the sound builds a little and identifies itself the sea. Ship timbers, wind in the rigging, and then shouts of sailors calling obscure but inescapably nautical instructions from all directions, far and near: A short list:
Hard a larboard!
Let go the stays!
Reef down me hearties!
Is that you, cox'n?
Hel-llo! Is that you?
Hard a port!
Easy as she goes!
Keep her steady on the lee!
Haul away, lads!
SNATCHES OF SEA SHANTY MAYBE
Fly the jib!
Tops'l up, me maties!)
(When the point has been well made and more so.)
ROS. We're on a boat. (Pause.) Dark, isn't it?
GUIL. Not for night.
ROS. No, not for night.
GUIL. Dark for day.
(Pause.)
ROS. Oh yes, it's dark for day.
GUIL. We must have gone north, of course.
ROS. Off course?
GUIL. Land of the midnight sun, that is.
ROS. Of course.
(Some sailor sounds.)
(A lantern is lit upstage— in fact by HAMLET.)
(The stage lightens disproportionately):
(Enough to see:)
(Ros and GUIL sitting downstage.)
(Vague shapes of rigging, etc., behind.)
I think it's getting light.
GUIL. Not for night.
ROS. This far north.
GUIL. Unless we're off course.
ROS. (small pause): Of course.
(A better light-Lantern? Moon?... Light.)
(Revealing, among other things, three large man-sized casks on deck, upended, with lids. Spaced but in line. Behind and above-a gaudy striped umbrella, on a pole stuck into the deck, tilted so that we do not see behind it— one of those huge six-foot diameter jobs. Still dim upstage.)
(Ros and GUIL still facing front.)
ROS. Yes, it's lighter than it was. It'll be night soon. This far north. (Dolefully.) I suppose we'll have to go to sleep. (He yawns and stretches.)
GUIL. Tired?
ROS. No... I don't think I'd take to it. Sleep all night, can't see a thing all day... Those eskimos must have a quiet life.
GUIL. Where?
ROS. What?
GUIL. I thought you— (Relapses.) I've lost all capacity for disbelief. I'm not sure that I could even rise to a little gentle scepticism.
(Pause.)
ROS. Well, shall we stretch our legs?
GUIL. I don't feel like stretching my legs.
ROS. I'll stretch them for you, if you like.
GUIL. No.
ROS. We could stretch each other's. That way we wouldn't have
to go anywhere.
GUIL. (pause): No, somebody might come in.
ROS. In where?
GUIL. Out here.
ROS. In out here?
GUIL. On deck.
(Ros considers the floor: slaps it.)
ROS. Nice bit of planking, that.
GUIL. Yes, I'm very fond of boats myself. I like the way they're
—contained. You don't have to worry about which way to go, or whether to go at all-the question doesn't arise, because you're on a boat, aren't you? Boats are safe areas in the game of tag.. the players will hold their positions until the music starts... I think I'll spend most of my life on boats.
ROS. Very healthy.
(Ros inhales with expectation, exhales with boredom. GUIL stands up and looks over the audience.)
GUIL. One is free on a boat. For a time. Relatively.
ROS. What's it like?
GUIL. Rough.
(Ros joins him. They look out over the audience.)
ROS. I think I'm going to be sick.
(GUIL licks a finger, holds it up experimentally.)
GUIL. Other side, I think.
(Ros goes upstage: Ideally a sort of upper deck joined to the downstage lower deck by short steps. The umbrella being on the upper deck. Ros pauses by the umbrella and looks behind
(GUIL meanwhile has been resuming his own theme— looking out over the audience-
Free to move, speak, extemporise, and yet. We have not been cut loose. Our truancy is defined by one fixed star, and our drift represents merely a slight change of angle to it: we may seize the moment, toss it around while the moments pass, a short dash here, an exploration there, but we are brought round full circle to face again the single immutable fact— that we, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, bearing a letter from one king to another, are taking Hamlet to England.
(By which time, Ros has returned, tiptoeing with great import, teeth clenched for secrecy, gets to GUIL, points surreptitiously behind him—and a tight whisper:)
ROS. I say—he's there!
GUIL. (unsurprised): What's he doing?
ROS. Sleeping.
GUIL. By himself?
ROS. Yes.
GUIL. It's all right for him.
ROS. What is?
GUIL. He can sleep.
ROS. It's all right for him.
GUIL. He's got us now.
ROS. He can sleep.
GUIL. It's all done for him.
ROS. He's got us.
GUIL. And we've got nothing. (A cry.) All I ask is our common
due!
ROS. For those in peril on the sea...
GUIL. Give us this day our daily cue.
(Beat, pause. Sit. Long pause.)
ROS. (after shifting, looking around): What now?
GUIL. What do you mean?
ROS. Well, nothing is happening.
GUIL. We're on a boat.
ROS. I'm aware of that.
GUIL. (angrily): Then what do you expect? (Unhappily.) We act on scraps of information... sifting half-remembered directions that we can hardly separate from instinct.
(Ros puts a hand into his purse, then both hands behind his back, then holds his fists out.)
(GUIL taps one fist.)
(Ros opens it to show a coin.)
(He gives it to GUIL.)
(He puts his hand back into his purse. Then both hands behind his back, then holds his fists out.)
(GUIL taps one.)
(Ros opens it to show a coin. He gives it to GUIL.)
(Repeat.)
(Repeat.)
(GUIL getting tense. Desperate to lose.)
(Repeat.)
(GUIL taps a hand, changes his mind, taps the other, and ROS inadvertently reveals that he has a coin in both fists.)
GUIL. You had money in both hands.
ROS. (embarrassed): Yes.
GUIL. Every time?
ROS. Yes.
GUIL. What's the point of that?
ROS. (pathetic): I wanted to make you happy.
(Beat.)
GUIL. How much did he give you?
ROS. Who ?
GUIL. The king. He gave us some money.
ROS. How much did he give you?
GUIL. I asked you first.
ROS. I got the same as you.
GUIL. He wouldn't discriminate between us.
ROS. How much did you get?
GUIL. The same.
ROS. How do you know?
GUIL. You just told me-how do you know?
ROS. He wouldn't discriminate between us.
GUIL. Even if he could.
ROS. Which he never could.
GUIL. He couldn't even be sure of mixing us up.
ROS. Without mixing us up.
GUIL. (turning on him furiously): Why don't you say something original! No wonder the whole thing is so stagnant! You don't take me up on anything- you just repeat it in a different order.
ROS. I can't think of anything original. I'm only good in
support.
GUIL. I'm sick of making the running.
ROS. (humbly): It must be your dominant personality. (Almost in
tears.) Oh, what's going to become of us!
(And GUIL comforts him, all harshness gone.)
GUIL. Don't cry ... it's all right... there... there, I'll see
we're all right.
ROS. But we've got nothing to go on, we're out on our own.
GUIL. We're on our way to England-we're taking Hamlet
there.
ROS. What for?
GUIL. What for? Where have you been?
ROS. When? (Pause.) We won't know what to do when we get
there.
GUIL. We take him to the king.
ROS. Will he be there?
GUIL. No-the king of England.
ROS. He's expecting us?
GUIL. No.
ROS. He won't know what we're playing at. What are we going
to say?
GUIL. We've got a letter. You remember the letter,
ROS. Do I?
GUIL. Everything is explained in the letter. We count on that.
ROS. Is that it, then?
GUIL. What?
ROS. We take Hamlet to the English king, we hand over the
letter-what then?
GUIL. There may be something in the letter to keep us going a
bit.
ROS. And if not?
GUIL. Then that's it-we're finished.
ROS. At a loose end?
GUIL. Yes.
(Pause.)
ROS. Are there likely to be loose ends? (Pause.) Who is the
English King?
GUIL. That depends on when we get there.
ROS. What do you think it says?
GUIL. Oh. .. greetings. Expressions of loyalty. Asking of
favours, calling in of debts. Obscure promises balanced by vague threats... Diplomacy. Regards to the family.
ROS. And about Hamlet?
GUIL. Oh yes.
ROS. And us—the full background?
GUIL. I should say so.
(Pause.)
ROS. So we've got a letter which explains everything.
GUIL. You've got it.
(Ros takes that literally. He starts to pat his pockets, etc.)
What's the matter?
ROS. The letter.
GUIL. Have you got it?
ROS. (rising fear): Have I? (Searches frantically.) Where would I
have put it?
GUIL. You can't have lost it.
ROS. I must have!
GUIL. That's odd—I thought he gave it to me.
(Ros looks at him hopefully.)
ROS. Perhaps he did.
GUIL. But you seemed so sure it was you who hadn't got it.
ROS. (high): It was me who hadn't got it!
GUIL. But if he gave it to me there's no reason why you should have had it in the first place, in which case I don't see what all the fuss is about you not having it.
ROS. (pause): I admit it's confusing.
GUIL. This is all getting rather undisciplined... The boat, the night, the sense of isolation and uncertainty ... all these induce a loosening of the concentration. We must not lose control. Tighten up. Now. Either you have lost the letter or you didn't have it to lose in the first place, in which case the king never gave it to you, in which case he gave it to me, in which case I would have put it into my inside top pocket in which case (calmly producing the letter) ... it will be ... here. (They smile at each other.) We mustn't drop off like that again.
(Pause. ROS takes the letter gently from him.)
ROS. Now that we have found it, why were we looking for it?
GUIL. (thinks): We thought it was lost.
ROS. Something else?
GUIL. No.
(Deflation.)
ROS. Now we've lost the tension.
GUIL. What tension?
ROS. What was the last thing I said before we wandered off?
GUIL. When was that?
ROS. (helplessly): I can't remember.
GUIL. (leaping up) What a shambles! We're just not getting
anywhere.
ROS. (mournfully) Not even England. I don't believe in it anyway.
GUIL. What?
ROS. England.
GUIL. Just a conspiracy of cartographers, you mean?
ROS. I mean I don't believe it! (Calmer.) I have no image. I try to picture us arriving, a little harbour perhaps... roads ... inhabitants to point the way.. horses on the road... riding for a day or a fortnight and then a palace and the English king... That would be the logical kind of thing.
... But my mind remains a blank. No. We're slipping off the map.
GUIL. Yes... yes... (Rallying.) But you don't believe anything till it happens. And it has all happened. Hasn't it?
ROS. We drift down time, clutching at straws. But what good's
a brick to a drowning man?
GUIL. Don't give up, we can't be long now.
ROS. We might as well be dead. Do you think death could
possibly be a boat?
GUIL. No, no, no... Death is ... not. Death isn't. You take my meaning. Death is the ultimate negative. Not-being.
You can't not-be on a boat.
ROS. I've frequently not been on boats.
GUIL. No, no, no-what you've been is not on boats.
ROS. I wish I was dead. (Considers the drop.) I could jump over the side. That would put a spoke in their wheel.
GUIL. Unless they're counting on it.
ROS. I shall remain on board. That'll put a spoke in their wheel.
(The futility of it, fury.) All right! We don't question, we don't doubt. We perform. But a line must be drawn somewhere, and I would like to put it on record that I have no confidence in England. Thank you. (Thinks about this.) And even if it's true, it'll just be another shambles.
GUIL. I don't see why.
ROS. (furious) He won't know what we're talking about—What
are we going to say?
GUIL. We say-Your majesty, we have arrived!
ROS. (kingly): And who are you?
GUIL. We are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
ROS. (barks) Never heard of you!
GUIL. Well, we're nobody special-
ROS. (regal and nasty) What's your game?
GUIL. We've got our instructions-ROS. First I've heard of it-
GUIL. (angry) Let me finish
Denmark.
- (Humble.) We've come from
ROS. What do you want?
GUIL. Nothing-we're delivering Hamlet-ROS. Who's he?
GUIL irritated): You've heard of him-
ROS. Oh, I've heard of him all right and I want nothing to do
with it.
GUIL. But-
ROS. You march in here without so much as a by your leave and expect me to take in every lunatic you try to pass off with a lot of unsubstantiated-
GUIL. We've got a letter-
(Ros snatches it and tears it open.)
ROS. (efficiently) I see... I see ... well, this seems to support your story such as it is—it is an exact command from the king of Denmark, for several different reasons, importing Denmark's health and England's too, that on the reading of this letter, without delay, I should have Hamlet's head cut off-
-!
(GUIL snatches the letter. ROS, doubletaking, snatches it back.
GUIL snatches it half back. They read it together, and separate.)
(Pause.)
(They are well downstage looking front.)
ROS. The sun's going down. It will be dark soon.
GUIL. Do you think so?
ROS. I was just making conversation. (Pause.) We're his friends.
GUIL. How do you know?
ROS. From our young days brought up with him.
GUIL. You've only got their word for it.
ROS. But that's what we depend on.
GUIL. Well, yes, and then again no. (Airily.) Let us keep things in proportion. Assume, if you like, that they're going to kill him. Well, he is a man, he is mortal, death comes to us all, etcetera, and consequently he would have died anyway, sooner or later. Or to look at it from the social point of view—he's just one man among many, the loss would be well within reason and convenience. And then again, what is so terrible about death? As Socrates so philosophically put it, since we don't know what death is, it is illogical to fear it. It might be ... very nice. Certainly it is a release from the burden of life, and, for the godly, a haven and a reward. Or to look at it another way—we are little men, we don't know the ins and outs of the matter, there are wheels within wheels, etcetera—it would be presumptuous of us to interfere with the designs of fate or even of kings. All in all, 1 think we'd be well advised to leave well alone. Tie up the letter—there—neatly-like that-They won't notice the broken seal, assuming you were in character.
ROS. But what's the point?
GUIL. Don't apply logic.
ROS. He's done nothing to us.
GUIL. Or justice.
ROS. It's awful.
GUIL. But it could have been worse. I was beginning to think it
was. (And his relief comes out in a laugh.)
(Behind them HAMLET appears from behind the umbrella. The light has been going. Slightly. HAMLET is going to the lantern.)
ROS. The position as I see it, then. We, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, from our young days brought up with him, awakened by a man standing on his saddle, are summoned, and arrive, and are instructed to glean what afflicts him and draw him on to pleasures, such as a play, which unfortunately, as it turns out, is abandoned in some confusion owing to certain nuances outside our appreciation
—which, among other causes, results in, among other effects, a high, not to say, homicidal, excitement in Hamlet, whom we, in consequence, are escorting, for his own good, to England. Good. We're on top of it now.
(HAMLET blows out the lantern. The stage goes pitch black.) (The Black resolves itself to moonlight, by which HAMLET approaches the sleeping ROS and GUIL. He extracts the letter and takes it behind his umbrella; the light of his lantern shines through the fabric, HAMLET emerges again with a letter, and replaces it, and retires, blowing out his lantern.)
(Morning comes.)
(Ros watches it coming- from the auditorium. Behind him is a gay sight. Beneath the re-tilted umbrella, reclining in a deckchair, wrapped in a rug, reading a book, possibly smoking, sits HAMLET.)
(Ros watches the morning come, and brighten to high noon.)
ROS. I'm assuming nothing. (He stands up. GUIL wakes.)
The position as I see it, then. That's west unless we're off course, in which case it's night; the king gave me the same as you, the king gave you the same as me; the king never gave me the letter, the king gave you the letter, we don't know what's in the letter; we take Hamlet to the English king, it depending on when we get there who he is, and we hand over the letter, which may or may not have something in it to keep us going, and if not, we are finished and at a loose end, if they have loose ends. We could have done worse. I don't think we missed any chances... Not that we're getting much help. (He sits down again. They lie down-prone.) If we stopped breathing we'd vanish.
(The muffled sound of a recorder. They sit up with disproportionate interest.)
Here we go.
Yes, but what?
(They listen to the music.)
GUIL. (excitedly) Out of the void, finally, a sound; while on a boat (admittedly) outside the action (admittedly) the perfect and absolute silence of the wet lazy slap of water against water and the rolling creak of timber-breaks; giving rise at once to the speculation or the assumption or the hope that something is about to happen; a pipe is heard. One of the sailors has pursed his lips against a woodwind, his fingers and thumb governing, shall we say, the ventages, whereupon, giving it breath, let us say, with his mouth, it, the pipe, discourses, as the saying goes, most eloquent music. A thing like that, it could change the course of events.
(Pause.) Go and see what it is.
ROS. It's someone playing on a pipe.
GUIL. Go and find him.
ROS. And then what?
GUIL. I don't know-request a tune.
ROS. What for?
GUIL. Quick—before we lose our momentum.
ROS. Why!-something is happening. It had quite escaped my
attention!
(He listens: Makes a stab at an exit. Listens more carefully:
Changes direction:)
(GUIL takes no notice.)
(Ros wanders about trying to decide where the music comes from. Finally he tracks it down-unwillingly—to the middle barrel. There is no getting away from it. He turns to GUIL who takes no notice. ROS, during this whole business, never quite breaks into articulate speech. His face and his hands indicate his incredulity. He stands gazing at the middle barrel. The pipe plays on within. He kicks the barrel. The pipe stops. He leaps back towards GUIL. The pipe starts up again. He approaches the barrel cautiously. He lifts the lid.
The music is louder. He slams down the lid. The music is softer. He goes back towards GUIL. But a drum starts, muffled.
He freezes. He turns. Considers the left-hand barrel. The drumming goes on within, in time to the flute. He walks back to GUIL. He opens his mouth to speak. Doesn't make it. A lute is heard. He spins round at the third barrel. More instruments join in. Until it is quite inescapable that inside the three barrels, distributed, playing together a familiar tune which has been heard three times before, are the TRAGEDIANS.)
(They play on.)
(Ros sits beside GUIL. They stare ahead.)
(The tune comes to an end.)
(Pause.)
ROS. I thought I heard a band. (In anguish.) Plausibility is all I
presume!
GUIL. (coda) Call us this day our daily tune...
(The lid of the middle barrel flies open and the PLAYER's head pops out.)
PLAYER. Aha! All in the same boat, then! (He climbs out. He
goes round banging on the barrels.)
Everybody out!
the sti, the eas hot dia. ger the hate except
ALFRED. The PLAYER is cheerful.)
(To ROS.) Where are we?
ROS. Travelling.
PLAYER. Of course, we haven't got there yet.
ROS. Are we all right for England?
PLAYER. You look all right to me. I don't think they're very
particular in England. Al-1-fred!
(ALFRED emerges from the PLAYER's barrel.)
Good boy! Always underneath.
GUIL. What are you doing here?
PLAYER. Travelling. (To TRAGEDIANS.) Right-blend into the
background!
(The TRAGEDIANS are in costume (from the mime): A King with crown, ALFRED as Queen, Poisoner and the two Cloaked figures.)
(To GUIL.) Actors!-too scruffy to pass for passengers, too lazy to pass for crew. Let me not be known by the
i company 1 keep.
TRAGEDIANS.
by the company 1 keeping resentful boredom.)
PLAYER. Blend! (He passes among them.) (POISONER) Steward ...
(ALFRED) Cabin girl... Deck hand... Deck hand...
(KING. Pause.) Pretender.
(They blend.)
(To GUIL.) Pleased to see us? (Pause.) You've come out of it very well, so far.
GUIL. And you?
PLAYER. In disfavour. Our play offended the king.
GUIL. Yes.
PLAYER. Well, he's a second husband himself. Tactless, really.
ROS. It was quite a good play nevertheless.
PLAYER. We never really got going-it was getting quite
interesting when they stopped it.
(Looks up at HAMLET.)
That's the way to travel...
GUIL. What were you doing in there?
PLAYER. Hiding. (Indicating costumes.) We had to run for it just
as we were.
ROS. Stowaways.
PLAYER. Naturally-we didn't get paid, owing to circumstances ever so slightly beyond our control, and all the money we had we lost betting on certainties. Life is a gamble, at terrible odds—if it was a bet you wouldn't take it. Did you know that any number doubled is even?
ROS. Is it?
PLAYER. We learn something every day, to our cost. But we troupers just go on and on. Do you know what happens to old actors?
ROS. What?
PLAYER. Nothing. They're still acting. Surprised, then?
GUIL. What?
PLAYER. Surprised to see us?
GUIL. I knew it wasn't the end.
PLAYER. With practically everyone on his feet. What do you make
of it, so far?
GUIL. We haven't got much to go on.
PLAYER. You speak to him?
ROS. It's possible.
GUIL. But it wouldn't make any difference.
ROS. But it's possible.
GUIL. Pointless.
ROS. It's allowed.
GUIL. Allowed, yes. We are not restricted. No boundaries have been defined, no inhibitions imposed. We have, for the while, secured, or blundered into, our release, for the while.
Spontaneity and whim are the order of the day. Other wheels are turning but they are not our concern. We can breathe. We can relax. We can do what we like and say what we like to whomever we like, without restriction.
ROS. Within limits, of course.
GUIL. Certainly within limits.
(HAMLET comes down to footlights and regards the audience.
The others watch but don't speak. HAMLET clears his throat noisily and spits into the audience. A split second later he claps his hand to his eye and wipes himself. He goes back upstage.).
ROS. Á compulsion towards philosophical introspection is his chief characteristic, if I may put it like that. It does not mean he is mad. It does not mean he isn't. Very often, it does not mean anything at all. Which may or may not be a kind of madness.
GUIL. It really boils down to symptoms. Pregnant replies, mystic allusions, mistaken identities, arguing his father is his mother, that sort of thing; intimations of suicide, forgoing of exercise, loss of mirth, hints of claustrophobia not to say delusions of imprisonment; invocations of camels, chameleons, capons, whales, weasels, hawks, handsaws-riddles, quibbles and evasions; amnesia, paranoia, myopia; day-dreaming, hallucinations; stabbing his elders, abusing his parents, insulting his lover, and appearing hatless in public-knock-kneed, droop-stockinged and sighing like a love-sick schoolboy, which at his age is coming on a bit strong.
ROS. And talking to himself.
GUIL. And talking to himself.
(Ros and GUIL move apart together.)
Well, where has that got us?
ROS. He's the Player.
GUIL. His play offended the king
ROS. — offended the king
GUIL. —who orders his arrest-ROS. —orders his arrest
GUIL. —so he escapes to England ROS. On the boat to which he meets
GUIL. Guildenstern and Rosencrantz taking Hamlet-ROS. —who also offended the king
GUIL. —and killed Polonius
ROS. —offended the king in a variety of ways
GUIL. —to England. (Pause.) That seems to be it.
(RoS jumps up.)
ROS. Incidents! All we get is incidents! Dear God, is it too much to expect a little sustained action?!
(And on the word, the PIRATES attack. That is to say: Noise and shouts and rushing about. "Pirates".
(Everyone visible goes frantic. HAMLET draws his sword and rushes downstage. GUIL, ROS and PLAYER draw swords and rush upstage. Collision. HAMLET turns back up. They turn back down. Collision. By which time there is general panic right upstage. All four charge upstage with ROS, GUIL and PLAYER shouting:
(At last!
To arms!
Pirates!
Up there!
Down there!
To my sword's length!
Action!)
(All four reach the top, see something they don't like, waver, run for their lives downstage:)
(HAMLET, in the lead, leaps into the left barrel. PLAYER leaps into the right barrel. Ros and GUIL leap into the middle barrel. All closing the lids after them.)
(The lights dim to nothing while the sound of fighting continues. The sound fades to nothing. The lights come up.)
(The middle barrel (ROS's and GUIL's) is missing.)
(The lid of the right-hand barrel is raised cautiously, the heads of Ros and GUIL appear.)
(The lid of the other barrel (HAMLET's) is raised. The head of the PLAYER appears.)
(All catch sight of each other and slam down lids.)
(Pause.)
(Lids raised cautiously.)
ROS. (relief) They've gone. (He starts to climb out.) That was
close. I've never thought quicker.
(They are all three out of barrels. GUIL is wary and nervous.
ROS is light-headed. The PLAYER is phlegmatic. They note the missing barrel.)
(Ros look round.)
ROS. Where's-?
(The PLAYER takes off his hat in mourning.)
PLAYER. Once more, alone on our own resources.
GUIL. (worried): What do you mean? Where is he?
PLAYER. Gone.
GUIL. Gone where ?
PLAYER. Yes, we were dead lucky there. If that's the word I'm
after.
ROS. (not a pick up) Dead?
PLAYER. Lucky.
ROS. (he means) Is he dead?
PLAYER. Who knows?
GUIL. (rattled) He's not coming back?
PLAYER. Hardly.
ROS. He's dead then. He's dead as far as we're concerned.
PLAYER. Or we are as far as he is. (He goes and sits on the floor
to one side.) Not too bad, is it?
GUIL. (rattled) But he can't—We're supposed to be-We've got a letter —We're going to England with a letter for the king-
PLAYER. Yes, that much seems certain. I congratulate you on
the unambiguity of your situation.
GUIL. But you don't understand—it contains-we've had our instructions-The whole thing's pointless without him.
PLAYER. Pirates could happen to anyone. Just deliver the letter.
They'll send ambassadors from England to explain...
GUIL. (worked up) Can't you see—the pirates left us home and high, dry and home-drome-turiously). The pirates left us high and dry!
PLAYER. (comforting) There...
GUIL. (near tears) Nothing will be resolved without him...
PLAYER. There... !
GUIL. We need Hamlet for our release!
PLAYER. There!
GUIL. What are we supposed to do?
PLAYER. This.
(He turns away, lies down if he likes. ROS and GUIL apart.)
ROS. Saved again.
GUIL. Saved for what?
(ROS sighs.)
ROS. The sun's going down. (Pause.) It'll be night soon. (Pause.)
If that's west. (Pause.) Unless we've
GUIL. (shouts): Shut up! I'm sick of it! Do you think conversation is going to help us now?
ROS. (hurt, desperately ingratiating): I-I bet you all the money I've got the year of my birth doubled is an odd number.
GUIL. (moan): No-o.
ROS. Your birth!
(GUIL smashes him down.)
GUIL. (broken): We've travelled too far, and our momentum has taken over; we move idly towards eternity, without possibility of reprieve or hope of explanation.
ROS. Be happy—If you're not even happy what's so good about surviving? (He picks himself up.) We'll be all right. I suppose we just go on.
GUIL. Go where?
ROS. To England.
GUIL. England! That's a dead end. I never believed in it anyway.
ROS. All we've got to do is make our report and that'll be that.
Surely.
GUIL. I don't believe it—A shore, a harbour, say-and we get off and we stop someone and say —Where's the king?— And he says, oh, you follow that road there and take the first left and-(furiously). I don't believe any of it!
ROS. It doesn't sound very plausible.
GUIL. And even if we came face to face, what do we say?
ROS. We say-We've arrived!
GUIL. (kingly): And who are you?
ROS. We are Guildenstern and Rosencrantz.
GUIL. Which is which?
ROS. Well, I'm-You're
GUIL. What's it all about?
ROS. Well, we were bringing Hamlet-but then some pirates GUIL. I don't begin to understand. Who are all these people, what's it got to do with me? You turn up out of the blue with some cock and bull story
ROS. (with letter) We have a letter-
GUIL. (snatches it, opens it) A letter—yes—that's true. That's something ..
I a letter ... (reads). "As England is
Denmark's faithful tributary ... as love between them like the palm might flourish, etcetera. that on the knowing of this contents, without delay of any kind, should those bearers, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, put to sudden death-
(He double takes. ROS snatches the letter. GUlL snatches it… back. Ros snatches it half back. They read it again and look up.)
(The PLAYER gets to his feet and walks over to his barrel and kicks it and shouts into it.)
PLAYER. They've gone, you cretinous scum!-It's all over!
(One by one the PLAYERS emerge, impossibly, from the barrel, and form a casually menacing circle round ROs and GUIL who are still appalled and mesmerised.)
ROS. They had it in for us, didn't they. Right from the beginning.
Who'd have thought that we were that important?
(GUIL has been standing, trembling. He wheels at the TRAGEDIANS.)
GUIL. (bursts out): What are you waiting for? What are you
staring at? (He stands trembling.)
ROS. (gently): Don't cry ... there's life in us yet.
GUIL. (quietly): We're dead men. What else could resolve the gathering dark through which we have stumbled this far? ...
(In anguish, to the PLAYER.) But why? (Quiet, trembling, now dangerous, capable of violence.) To be told so little... to such an end—and still-finally—to be denied an explanation.
... Was it really all for this? Who are we that so much should converge on our little deaths... ? (And to the PLAYER a threat, on the edge of vengeance:) You knew...
PLAYER. To know that, is nothing. In our experience death
is at the end of most things. ..
GUIL. (fear, vengeance, scorn): Your experience!— Actors!
(He snatches a dagger from the PLAYER's belt and holds the point at the PLAYER's throat: the PLAYER backs and GUIL advances, speaking more quietly.)
I'm talking about death-and you've never experienced that. And you cannot act it. You die a thousand casual deaths-with panache, and none of that intensity which squeezes out life... and no blood runs cold anywhere.
Because even as you die you know that you will come back in a different hat. But no one gets up after death-there is no applause there is only silence and some second-hand clothes, and that's-death-
(And he pushes the blade in up to the hilt. The PLAYER stands with huge, terrible eyes, clutches at the wound as the blade withdraws: he makes small weeping sounds and falls to his knees, and then right down:)
(While he is dying, GUIL, nervous, high, almost hysterical, wheels on the TRAGEDIANS-)
If we have a destiny, then so had he and if this is ours, then that was his-and if there are no explanations for us, then let there be none for him—
(The TRAGEDIANS watch the PLAYER die: they watch with some interest. The PLAYER finally lies still. A short moment of silence. Then the TRAGEDIANS start to applaud with genuine admiration. The PLAYER stands up, brushing himself down.)
PLAYER. (modestly): Oh, come, come, gentlemen—no flattery-it
was merely competent-
(The TRAGEDIANS are still congratulating him. The PLAYER approaches GUIL, who stands rooted, holding the dagger.)
PLAYER. What did you think? (Pause.) You see, it is the kind
they do believe in—it's what is expected.
(He holds his hand out for the dagger. GUIL slowly puts the point of the dagger on to the PLAYER's hand, and pushes ... the blade slides back into the handle. The PLAYER smiles, reclaims the dagger.)
For a moment you thought I'd- cheated.
(Ros relieves his own tension with loud nervy laughter.)
ROS. Oh, very good! Very good! Took me in completely-didn't he take you in completely— (claps his hands.) Encore! Encore!
PLAYER. (activated, arms spread, the professional): Deaths for all ages and occasions! Deaths by suspension, convulsion, consumption, incision, execution, asphyxiation and malnutrition—! Climactic carnage, by poison and by steel!
Double deaths by duel—! Show!-Show them the difference between an old ham like me and instinctive genius-
(Ros's laughter and applause continues, binding together the succession of deaths and postures organized by the PLAYER at top speed
(ALFRED, still in his queen's costume, dies by poison: the PLAYER, with rapier, kills the "KING" and duels with a fourth TRAGEDIAN, inflicting and receiving a wound: the two remaining TRAGEDIANS, the two "SPIEs" dressed in the same coats as ROS and GUIL, are stabbed, as before.)
(Under this is Ros's laughter and the PLAYER's galvanic barking of his lines, from "Climactic carnage...")
(And the light is fading over the deaths which take place right upstage.)
(Dying amid the dying-tragically; romantically.) So there's an end to that-it's commonplace: light goes with life, and in the winter of your years the dark comes early...
GUIL. (tired, drained, but an edge of impatience): No, no, no.
It's nothing like that... Death is not romantic... death is not anything ... death is ... not. It's the absence of presence, nothing more ... the endless time of never coming back... A gap you can't see, and when the wind blows through it, it makes no sound...
The light upstage has gone. Only GUIL and Ros are visible as Ros's clapping falters to silence.)
(Pause.)
ROS. That's it, then.
GUIL. Where we went wrong was getting on a boat. Boats are a mistake, we should have thought of that. We can move, of course, change direction, rattle about, but our movement is contained within a larger one that carries us along as inexorably as the wind and current...
(He looks up, his face in the remaining light.)
What was it all about? And when did it begin? Did we fall or were we pushed? Or was it too late even before it began... ?
(Ros moves a little upstage towards the dark.)
ROS. Are you coming?
GUIL. (bursts out) We've done nothing wrong! We didn't harm
anyone. Did we?
ROS. I can't remember. (He turns front and looks out.) The sun's going down. Or the earth's coming up, as the fashionable theory has it.
GUIL. We could just stay put, couldn't we?
ROS. (turns back upstage): Not that it makes any difference.
(Ros moves into the upstage dark and disappears. GUIL does not notice.)
GUIL. I mean, no one's going to come on and drag us off. They'll just have to wait. We're still young ... fit... We've got years... (He looks for Ros and finds he is alone. He jumps to his feet and shouts wildly.) Rosen-
-! Guilden-
!
(Pause. He pulls himself together.) Well, all right then. I don't care. I've had enough. I'm relieved. (He moves upstage.)
Now you see me-now you (And disappears from view.)
(Immediately the whole stage is lit up, revealing, upstage, arranged in the approximate positions last held by the dead TRAGEDIANS, the tableau of court and corpses which is the last scene of Hamlet.)
(That is: The KING, QUEEN, LAERTES and HAMLET all dead.
HORATIO holds HAMLET. FORTINBRAS is there.)
(So are two AMBASSADORS from England.)
AMBASSADOR. The sight is dismal;
and our affairs from England come too late.
The ears are senseless that should give us hearing to tell him his commandment is fulfilled, that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.
Where should we have our thanks?
HORATIO: Not from his mouth,
had it the ability of life to thank you:
He never gave commandment for their death.
But since, so jump upon this bloody question, you from the Polack wars, and you from England, are here arrived, give order that these bodies high on a stage be placed to the view; and let me speak to the yet unknowing world how these things came about: so shall you hear of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts, of accidental judgments, casual slaughters, of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause, and, in this upshot, purposes mistook fallen on the inventors' heads: all this can 1 truly deliver.
PORTINBRAS: Let us haste to hear it, And call the noblest to the audience.
For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
I have some rights of memory in this kingdom, which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
HORATIO. Of that I shall have cause to speak,
and from his mouth whose voice will draw on more: but let this same be presently performed, even while men's hands are wild, lest more mischance on plots and errors happen.
FORTINBRAS. Let four captains
bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage: for he was likely, had he been put on, to have proved most royally: and for his passage, the soldiers' music and the rite of war speak loudly for him.
Take up the bodies: such a sight as this becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
(The BODIES are picked up: a peal of ordnance is shot off. A dead march begins and continues until the stage is empty except for the two AMBASSADORS.)
(Pause. They move downstage. They stop.)
AMBASSADOR. Hm...
2ND AMB. Yes?
1ST AMB. What?
2ND AMB. I thought you-
1ST AMB. No.
2ND AMB. Ah.
(Pause.)
1ST AMB. Tsk tsk...
2ND AMB. Quite.
1ST AMB. Shocking business.
2ND AMB. Tragic.. he looks in the direction of the departing corpses) ... four... just like that.
1sT AMB. Six in all.
2ND AMB. Seven.
1ST AMB. No-six.
2ND AMB. The King, the Queen, Hamlet, Laertes, Rosencrantz Guildenstern and Polonius. Seven.
1ST AMB. Ophelia. Eight.
2ND AMB. King, Queen, Hamlet, Laertes, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Polonius, Ophelia. Eight.
(They nod and shake their heads.)
(Looks about.) Well... One hardly knows what to. • (From outside there is shouting and banging, a MAN, say, banging his fist on a wooden door and shouting, obscurely, two names.)
(The AMBASSADORS look at each other.)
1ST AMB. Better go and see what it's all about...
(The other nods.)
(They walk off together. The TRAGEDIANS' tune becomes audible-far away.)
(The house lights come up until they are as bright as the lights on the empty stage.)
